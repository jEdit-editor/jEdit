COLOR SCHEMES

This directory contains several .jar files that you can drop in your
`jars' directory to give jEdit a funky new look.

On Windows: put JAR files in C:\Program Files\jEdit\jars 
On Unix: put JAR files in  /opt/slava/share/jedit-<version>/jars

NOTE: You will have to either a) delete your .jedit-props file, or
b) edit your .jedit-props and remove all view.<...>Color and
buffer.color.<...> statements for the themes to work.
