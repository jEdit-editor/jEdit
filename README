JEDIT README (README, last modified 8 Oct 1998)

jEdit is a text editor written in Java. I wrote it to learn more about JFC
programming. This is a pre-release version. See the VERSION file to see what
remains to be done.

jEdit requires a Java 1.1 compatible runtime and Sun's Java Foundation Classes
version 1.0.x. jEdit does NOT currently run with Swing 1.1beta3 or higher. When
1.1 is finished, I'll port jEdit, but in the meantime, use 1.0.x or 1.1beta2.

A Java runtime for Solaris and Windows can be found at
<http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1>. A Linux version is available at
<http://java.blackdown.org>. The JFC can be obtained from
<http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html>.

To get started with jEdit, I suggest you take a look at doc/index.txt. You
might also want to take a look at the contents of the etc/ directory, it
contains some useful goodies.

jEdit is under the GNU General Public License, read the enclosed COPYING file
for more information. Basically, you can share jEdit and modify it all you
want, but you must give away your modifications under the same terms.

Have fun!
