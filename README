1. About jEdit
--------------
jEdit is a powerful text editor written in Java. I wrote it to learn more
about JFC programming.

jEdit is released under the GNU General Public License, read the enclosed
COPYING file for more information. Basically, you can share jEdit and modify it
all you want, but you must give away your modifications under the same terms.

2. Installing jEdit
-------------------
jEdit requires a Java 1.1 compatible runtime and Sun's Java Foundation Classes
version 1.0.x. jEdit does NOT currently run with Swing 1.1beta3 or higher. When
1.1 is finished, I'll port jEdit, but in the meantime, use 1.0.x or 1.1beta2.

A Java runtime for Solaris and Windows can be found at
<http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1>. A Linux version is available at
<http://java.blackdown.org>. The JFC can be obtained from
<http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html>.

2.1. Unix
---------
Use the supplied Makefile. Log in as root and `make install' in the jEdit
directory. If for some reason you want to recompile the source, do a `make'
before the `make install'.

By default, everything will be installed under /opt/slava. If you want to
install jEdit elsewhere, edit the Make.rules file.

2.2. Windows 95, 98 and NT
--------------------------
Use the installit.bat batch file to install it. By default, everything will be
installed under C:\Program Files\jEdit. If you don't like this, edit the
installit.bat file.

3. Getting Started
------------------
To get started with jEdit, I suggest you take a look at doc/index.txt.

Have fun!
