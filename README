JEDIT README (README, last modified 29 Sep 1998)

jEdit is a text editor written in Java. I wrote it to learn more about JFC
programming. This is a pre-release version. Currently, it can do simple text
editing, but more advanced features such as search and replace aren't done yet.

To get started with jEdit, I suggest you take a look at doc/index.txt. You
might also want to take a look at the contents of the etc/ directory, it
contains some useful goodies.

jEdit is under the GNU General Public License, read the enclosed COPYING file
for more information. Basically, you can share jEdit and modify it all you
want, but you must give away your modifications under the same terms.

Have fun!
