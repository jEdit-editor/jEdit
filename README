JEDIT README

This is a pre-release version of jEdit. jEdit is a text editor written in Java.
It uses the Java Foundation Classes from Sun.

This version loads plugins and files, and can do simple text editing. However,
more advanced features such as search and replace aren't working yet.

There are installation instructions in INSTALL and some preliminary docs in
doc/.

If you write a plugin, send it to me and I'll include it in the next version of
jEdit.

Have fun!
