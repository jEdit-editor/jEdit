JARS README

This directory contains the `Latest Version Check' plugin
which performs automatic upgrade notification. It should also
serve as a sample of how jEdit plugins are written.

This directory can also used as a `build area' for third-party
plugins.

Plugins that are actually useful can be downloaded from
jEdit plugin central <http://www.icg-online.de/jedit/>.
