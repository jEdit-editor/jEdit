Java Pretty Print 1.0pre3
-------------------------
This is the JavaPrettyPrint plugin for jEdit. It is released under the
Artistic license (license.html), not the GPL like the rest of jEdit
because it uses the jstyle classes by Tal Davidson <tald@md2.huji.ac.il>.

IMPORTANT: Because of it's size, I didn't include the whole jstyle package,
only the part used by jEdit. The full package can be found at 
<http://www.bigfoot.com/~davidsont/jstyle/>.
