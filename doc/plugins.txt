1. Introduction
---------------
jEdit has a powerful plugin architecture. Plugins can be used to add 
almost any feature to jEdit. They are easy to write and even easier to 
install.

2. Installing Plugins
---------------------
Plugins are distributed as JAR files. They have a .jar extension. 

Plugins can be installed in one of two directories - the system plugin 
directory and the user plugin directory. Plugins in the system 
directory can be used by all users on the system. Plugins in a user's 
plugin directory can only be used by the respective user. 

On Unix, the system plugin directory is 
/opt/slava/share/jedit-<version>/jars, Each user has a plugin directory 
in $HOME/.jedit-jars. 

On Windows 95 and 98, the system plugin directory is C:\Program 
Files\jEdit\jars. The user plugin directory is %JAVAHOME%\.jedit-jars. 

On Windows NT, the system plugin directory is the same as that on 
Windows 95/98, but each user has a plugin directory in 
%HOME%\.jedit-jars.

3. Using Plugins
----------------
Once a plugin is installed, jEdit will say so during startup.

	Loading plugin /opt/slava/share/jedit-1.2final/jars/reverse.jar
	Loading plugin /opt/slava/share/jedit-1.2final/jars/rot13.jar

If all goes well during startup, the plugins should also appear in the 
`Plugins' menu. If a newly installed plugin doesn't appear to be 
loaded, check that it's in the correct directory and that it's a JAR 
file. 

If a plugin doesn't appear in the plugins menu but a `Loading...' 
message is printed, the plugin might be incompatible with your version 
of jEdit.
