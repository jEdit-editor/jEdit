JEDIT PLUGIN INTERFACE VERSION 1

1. Using Plugins
----------------
jEdit is extensible using plugins. A plugin is a JAR file with class and/or
property files. Plugins are searched for in the plugin path. The default path
is:
- The system plugin directory, (/opt/slava/share/jedit/1.00 on Unix,
  \Program Files\jEdit\share on Windows 95/NT).
- The user plugin directory (~/.jedit-jars on Unix, some JVM-dependent
  directory on Windows 95/NT).
Directories can be added to the plugin path with the -plugindir= parameter.

2. Developing Plugins
---------------------
To be useful, the JAR files must contain at least one .class or .props file.
The .props files are in standard Java property format. See props.txt for more
info. Each .class file is loaded into the runtime, and if it implements the
Command interface, a new instance of it is created and added to the command
list. See commands.txt for details.
