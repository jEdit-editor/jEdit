<h1>Wish List</h1>
</a>

<ul>
<li>Class/method/variable browser (the implementation is actally quite
easy - the hardest part is writing the source code parser)
<li>Make org.gjt.sp.jedit.syntax and org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.SyntaxTextArea
not dependant on Buffer/jEdit classes (maybe a SyntaxDocument interface,
or set/getTabSize/TokenMarker methods in SyntaxTextArea)
<li>Maybe make entire jEdit application a component that can be added to
other programs, but this is tricky
<li>One person has requested automatic word wrap - jEdit 1.0 and 1.1 had it,
but it got lost in the syntax colorizing scuffle of jEdit 1.2. I'm not too
keen on adding this since a) it requires major (well not major but considerable)
changes to my SyntaxView class, b) jEdit is designed to be mainly a programming
text editor, c) Edit-&gt;Format Text is there for manual word wrap, d)
nobody else has asked for this and I don't need it either
<li>Semi-automatic word wrap that inserts physical newlines if the line
gets too long isn't very hard, but once a line is split it isn't rejoined
again. Should ask that person if that's okay :) Maybe an Auto Format edit mode,
that HTML and TeX modes can subclass?
<li>Swing key maps should be editable
<li>`Keep dialog' option in search &amp; replace (is this really necessary?
I mean we already have C+g/C+e C+r/C+r C+y/C+e C+a for `Find Next', `Replace',
`Replace Selection' and `Replace All'
<li>Reload command
<li>Insert file command
<li>`Literal' search (no regexp) option
<li>`Fix' jEdit's lazy colorizing (no, I'm not going to do it)
</ul>

<a name=todo>
<h1>To Do</h1>
</a>

<ul>
<li>Should separate huge jEdit class into GUIUtilities/TextUtilities, move
buffer-related methods to Buffer class (as static methods), same for view
related stuff. Also move generic text manipulation stuff such as bracket
matching, etc to TextUtilities
<li>It would be nice if `Locate Bracket' and `Select Block' skipped over
comments/quoted literals that might contain unmatched brackets. This might
require a rewrite of Buffer.locateBracketBackward() and
Buffer.locateBracketForward().
<li>Sticky file format (open DOS file, saved as DOS file)
<li>For some reason splash screen doesn't appear until the first view is
created
<li>Backup directory feature, where all ...~ files are placed
<li>Scrolling isn't as slow as it was in jEdit 1.2, but still could be
better. A token cache could be used
<li>Typing is slow. Can be fixed by storing the last line tokenized, and
retokenizing from the caret position to the end of the line only
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in <code>jEdit.regionMatches</code> method, this caused problems
in HTML, Batch File mode

<a name=14pre2>
<h1>Version 1.4pre2</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Emacs-style error parsing added (If you use the very fast and very good
Jikes compiler, this means that you can give Jikes the +E option and jEdit
will parse the errors like it does with javac, etc)
<li>Javadoc (/** ... */) comments are now displayed in a different color
(thanks to Juha Lindfors &lt;jplindfo@cc.helsinki.fi&gt; for providing the code)

keyboard focus by default
<li>`Replace All' button in Search &amp; Replace now has an Alt+R mnemonic

select line range (and this makes it consitent with Go to Line which is
C+l)
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed minor bug where Compile Errors menu would be empty instead of
displaying `No Errors'
<li>Minor documentation updates
