<a name=todo>
<h1>To Do</h1>
</a>

<ul>
<li>Finish plugin documentation (commands, modes, syntax text area)
<li>jEdit 1.4/5's syntax colorizing seems slower than 1.3. It affects
all modes, so it's a bottleneck in some global method
<li>Views sometimes lose contact with their buffer
<li>view.divider property doesn't work properly
<li>DefaultSyntaxDocument calls insertLines() twice for each new line
(Swing bug?)
<li>Sometimes clicking on a color in the color options panel displays
the color picker dialog twice
<li>Non-existent files are opened twice by the console
</ul>

<a name=15pre4>
<h1>Version 1.5pre4</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>The org.gjt.sp.jedit.SyntaxTextArea class can now be used outside
of jEdit; simply add it to any container to get a bracket matching,
syntax colorizing text component
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Code cleanups
<li>Menu items look better now
<li>Plugin documentation updates
<li>Number of items in history lists decreased to 25 because of performance
problems
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed compile error with JDK 1.2 javac in Buffer.java
<li>Fixed stupid backup bug
<li>Batch file token marker colorized stuff like C:\bob\fred.exe incorrectly
<li>Invalid file names in compiler errors caused problems
<li>The enterView() and leaveView() methods of the Mode interface are
*ahem* actually called now
<li>View would add lots of empty entires to the console history
</ul>

</a>

referenced
<li>New plugin interface, implementations of which are responsible for
adding actions and modes to the editor
<li>New <code>DefaultSyntaxDocument</code> class which provides a
sample implementation of <code>SyntaxDocument</code>. Should make using
jEdit's syntax colorizing in other apps easier
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Miscallaneous code cleanups
<li>Plugin documentation updates
<li>Superclass of EditAction changed to ActionListener, no more
Swing action overhead
<li>More recent items appear at the top of the history combo box list
