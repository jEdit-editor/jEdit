<h1>Wish List For Future Versions</h1>
</a>

<ul>
<li>Class/method/variable browser (the implementation is actally quite
easy - the hardest part is writing the source code parser)
<li>Make org.gjt.sp.jedit.syntax and org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.SyntaxTextArea
not dependant on Buffer/jEdit classes (maybe a SyntaxDocument interface,
or set/getTabSize/TokenMarker methods in SyntaxTextArea)
<li>Maybe make entire jEdit application a component that can be added to
other programs, but this is tricky
<li>One person has requested automatic word wrap - jEdit 1.0 and 1.1 had it,
but it got lost in the syntax colorizing scuffle of jEdit 1.2. I'm not too
keen on adding this since a) it requires major (well not major but considerable)
changes to my SyntaxView class, b) jEdit is designed to be mainly a programming
text editor, c) Edit-&gt;Format Text is there for manual word wrap, d)
nobody else has asked for this and I don't need it either
<li>Semi-automatic word wrap that inserts physical newlines if the line
gets too long isn't very hard, but once a line is split it isn't rejoined
again. Should ask that person if that's okay :) Maybe an Auto Format edit mode,
that HTML and TeX modes can subclass?
<li>Swing key maps should be editable
<li>Insert file command
<li>`Literal' search (no regexp) option
<li>`Fix' jEdit's lazy colorizing (no, I'm not going to do it)
<li>`Locate Bracket' and `Select Block' should skip
comments/quoted literals that might contain unmatched brackets.
<li>Backup directory feature, where all ...~ files are placed
<li>Syntax colorizing is still slow - should use a visible line cache to speed
up scrolling
<li>Error list component/toolbar/dialog
</ul>

<a name=todo>
<h1>To Do For 1.4</h1>
</a>

<ul>
<li>Context menu - mnemonics/arrows don't work, and selection is extended if
mouse is held down
<li>Typing lags behind on last line of document? I think this is a Swing bug...
<li>Toolbar options panel
<li>Toolbar position should be saved (top/left/right/bottom/undocked/x/y)
<li>Console should acquire compile `lock' so that there is only one compile
going at once
</ul>
</ul>

<a name=14pre7>
<h1>Version 1.4pre7</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Simple toolbar added
<li>New `console' window to replace old `command output' - it is much more
powerful
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Error list menu was created incorrectly sometimes
<li>Keywords weren't colorized correctly sometimes
</ul>

<a name=14pre6>
<h1>Version 1.4pre6</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>The position of the editor window and most dialogs is now saved to the
properties and restored when jEdit is reopened
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>`Accents to HTML Entities' plugin optimizations (Romain Guy)
<li>Desktop file isn't used anymore - session is stored in the properties
<li>Major code reorganization
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Files got corrupted if the line separator was set to DOS/Windows in
the Options dialog box (this only affected new files, existing files are
safe)
<li>Find Selection didn't work
<li>Soft tabs didn't work in text mode
<li>Desktop wasn't saved sometimes
<li>Using the history would delete what was already entered in the text field
</ul>

<a name=14pre5>
<h1>Version 1.4pre5</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Reload command added
<li>Right click menu added to text area (doesn't work very well yet)
<li>History in Search &amp; Replace and HyperSearch - use up and down
arrow keys to recall previous search strings (Doesn't work very well yet)
<li>Keep dialog option in Search &amp; Replace
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Electric borders aren't as `agressive' - scrolling starts at three
lines from the top or bottom, not four like before
<li>Block caret is now off by default
<li>Files are added to the recent list when they're closed, not opened
<li>HyperSearch dialog beeps when no matches were found
<li>Faster keyword map (uses character arrays instead of strings) should make
C, C++, Java, JavaScript and SQL mode faster
<li>Transact-SQL mode optimizations (Mike Dillon)
<li>Minor syntax colorizing speedups (less array copying) (Mike Dillon)
<li>Redundant calls to ensureCapacity() removed from token markers (Mike Dillon)
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>`Font Style' setting in Options should work now (why do I always
mess up in the options dialog box?)
<li>Sometimes C++ keywords weren't colorized
<li>Fixed obscure backup bug nobody has ever seen (if you do a `save as'
to a different directory than the original file, the backup is created
in the wrong directory)
<li>Some constructs would be colorized as labels in C/C++/Java mode
<li>Fixed very obscure syntax colorizing bug (insertLine() was called
one too many times, this is probably what caused the random multiline
comment glitches, and so on)
<li>Fixed several buffers menu updating bugs
</ul>

<a name=14pre4>
<h1>Version 1.4pre4</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added TSQL mode (Mike Dillon)
<li>Added Block Caret setting in Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Editor
<li>Sticky file format (when a file is loaded, jEdit tries to guess the
line separators. When it is saved, the original line separators are used.
Makes it easier for people who deal with both DOS and Unix files)
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Improved KeywordMap, might make C/C++/Java mode faster (Mike Dillon)
<li>Double clicking on items in `Paste Previous' and `Paste Predefined'
has the same effect as pressing `Insert' (Mike Dillon)
<li>Size of I/O buffers increased from 8K to 32K - should make file saving
and loading faster
<li>Removed redundant scanning pass from CTokenMarker - should be about
50% faster
<li>(, ) characters are now optional in buffer-local properties, for example
you can now write :tabSize=4: instead of (:tabSize=4:) in the first 10 lines
of a file
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Batch file mode had an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds condition (Mike Dillon)
<li>HyperSearch dialog didn't resize properly (Mike Dillon)
<li>AltGR key should now work on Windows (Juha Lindfors)
<li>Shift Indent Left/Right had problems when shifting empty lines
<li>Line separator setting in Options dialog box didn't work
<li>README.txt referenced non-existent COPYING.txt (as of jEdit 1.3, it
is COPYING.html on the doc/ directory)
</ul>

<a name=14pre3>
<h1>Version 1.4pre3</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added patch mode for editing Unix diffs and patches (Yeah, it's kind of
cheap, but I was editing a diff the other day and thought, why not?)
<li>Added props mode for editing Java property files and DOS INI files
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in <code>jEdit.regionMatches</code> method, this caused problems
in HTML, Batch File mode
<li>`Replace in Selection' didn't work sometimes
<li>`Save All Buffers' saved all buffers - should only save changed ones

<li>Fixed bug with plugin classes >8K (thanks to 
Mike Dillon &lt;mdillon@uclink4.berkeley.edu&gt; for the fix)
<li>KeywordMap didn't work with case insensitive keywords (thanks to 
Mike Dillon &lt;mdillon@uclink4.berkeley.edu&gt; for the fix)
<li>Indentifiers such as the_class and no_break would be colorized incorrectly
in C/C++/Java mode
<li>Labels and ?: constructs should now be colorized correctly 99% of the time
</ul>

<a name=14pre2>
<h1>Version 1.4pre2</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Emacs-style error parsing added (If you use the very fast and very good
Jikes compiler, this means that you can give Jikes the +E option and jEdit
will parse the errors like it does with javac, etc)
<li>Javadoc (/** ... */) comments are now displayed in a different color
(thanks to Juha Lindfors &lt;jplindfo@cc.helsinki.fi&gt; for providing the code)
<li>`Save All Buffers' and `Select Line Range' commands added
<li>Search and replace now has `Replace in Selection' command
</ul>

keyboard focus by default
<li>`Replace All' button in Search &amp; Replace now has an Alt+R mnemonic
<li>`Scroll to Current Line' shortcut changed to C+e C+j, C+e C+l is now
select line range (and this makes it consitent with Go to Line which is
C+l)
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed minor bug where Compile Errors menu would be empty instead of
displaying `No Errors'
<li>Minor documentation updates
