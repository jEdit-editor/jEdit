<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

Within jEdit, keyboard shortcuts are written as
<i>modifier+key</i>, where <i>modifier</i> is S for Shift,
C for Control, or A for Alt. <i>key</i> is either a letter,
or a named key such as PageUp.<p>

Some keyboard shortcuts consist of more than one keystroke, for
example `Delete Paragraph' is <code>C+d C+e</code>. Both key
strokes must be pressed in the respective order.

<h1>Menu Item Shortcuts</h1>
</a>

The most frequently used menu item commands have keyboard shortcuts.
They are listed to the right of the menu item's label.

<a name=mnemonics>
<h1>Menu Mnemonics</h1>
</a>

Pressing the Alt key in combination with one of the underlined
characters in the menu bar activates the respective menu. Once a
menu is open, an item in it can be selected by pressing the
underlined character in its label.<p>

While a menu is open, the arrow keys can be used to select menu
items, and Space or Enter will activate the selected menu item.<p>

The F10 key can be used to activate the menu bar for menu
selection via arrow keys.

<a name=dialogs>
<h1>Dialog Shortcuts</h1>
</a>

All dialogs have an OK button which can be activated by pressing
the Enter key.<p>

Most dialogs also have a Cancel button which can be activated by
pressing the Escape key.<p>

Tab and Shift+Tab can be used to shift the keyboard focus to the
next and previous component in a dialog box.

<h1>Text Editing Shortcuts</h1>
</a>

The following editing shortcuts are supported by the main editor
component but are not listed in the menu bar.<p>

If Shift is held down in combination with any
key that moves the caret, the selection is extended, rather than the caret
being moved.

<table border=3>

<tr>
<td>Backspace</td> <td>Deletes the character before the caret.
If there is a selection, it will be deleted instead.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Delete</td> <td>Deletes the character after the caret.
If there is a selection, it will be deleted instead.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Left, Right, Up, Down</td> <td>Moves the caret in the
respective direction.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>C+Left, C+Right</td> <td>Moves the caret one word
backward and one word forward, respectively.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Home</td> <td>This behaves a little differently from the Home keys
of most other text editors - in fact, it emulates the Home key of the Brief
editor.<p>
Pressing Home when the caret is in the middle of the current line will move it
to the start of the line. When the caret is on the start of the
current line, it will be moved to the first visible position. When it is
on the first visible position, pressing Home will move it to the
beginning of the document.
</tr>

<tr>
<td>End</td> <td>This behaves a little differently from the End keys
of most other text editors - in fact, it emulates the End key of the Brief
editor.<p>
Pressing End when the caret is in the middle of the current line will move it
to the end of the line. When the caret is on the end of the
current line, it will be moved to the last visible position. When it is
on the last visible position, pressing End will move it to the
end of the document.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PageUp</td> <td>Moves the caret up one screenful of text.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PageDown</td> <td>Moves the caret down one screenful of text.</td>
</tr>

<h1>Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts</h1>
</a>

Menu item and text area shortcuts can be customized in
`File-&gt;Global Options-&gt;Shortcuts'.<p>

Some notes about the key binding editor:

<ul>
<li>The key bindings are specified as described in the first section of
this file - <i>modifiers</i>+<i>key</i>
<li>The modifiers is optional - so for example you can bind to function
keys, etc
<li>Each key binding can consist of up to two key strokes
<li>To reset to the default keys, you must delete your $HOME/.jedit/properties
file, or if you don't want to lose your settings, open it with a
text editor and remove all <i>xxx</i>.shortcut entires
<li>Changes to the key bindings take effect immediately, however the menu
item labels are not updated in currently opened views
</ul>
