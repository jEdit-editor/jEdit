<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

Within jEdit, keyboard shortcuts are written as
<i>modifier+key</i>, where <i>modifier</i> is S for Shift,
C for Control, or A for Alt. <i>key</i> is either a letter,
or a named key such as PageUp.<p>

Some keyboard shortcuts consist of more than one keystroke, for
example `Delete Paragraph' is <code>C+d C+e</code>. Both key
strokes must be pressed in the respective order.

<h1>Menu Item Shortcuts</h1>
</a>

The most frequently used menu item commands have keyboard shortcuts.
They are listed to the right of the menu item's label.

<a name=mnemonics>
<h1>Menu Mnemonics</h1>
</a>

Pressing the Alt key in combination with one of the underlined
characters in the menu bar activates the respective menu. Once a
menu is open, an item in it can be selected by pressing the
underlined character in its label.<p>

While a menu is open, the arrow keys can be used to select menu
items, and Space or Enter will activate the selected menu item.<p>

The F10 key can be used to activate the menu bar for menu
selection via arrow keys.

<a name=dialogs>
<h1>Dialog Shortcuts</h1>
</a>

All dialogs have an OK button which can be activated by pressing
the Enter key.<p>

Most dialogs also have a Cancel button which can be activated by
pressing the Escape key.<p>

Tab and Shift+Tab can be used to shift the keyboard focus to the
next and previous component in a dialog box.

<a name=text>
<h1>Text Editing Shortcuts</h1>
</a>

The following shortcuts are available in most text components,
including the main editor component and the text fields in various
dialogs.<p>

If Shift is held down in combination with any
of these keys, the selection is extended, rather than the caret
being moved.

<table border=3>

<tr>
<td>Backspace</td> <td>Deletes the character before the caret.
If there is a selection, it will be deleted instead.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Delete</td> <td>Deletes the character after the caret.
If there is a selection, it will be deleted instead.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Left, Right, Up, Down</td> <td>Moves the caret in the
respective direction.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>C+Left, C+Right</td> <td>Moves the caret one word
backward and one word forward, respectively.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Home</td> <td>Moves the caret to the start of the line.</td>
</tr>

</tr>

<h1>Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts</h1>
</a>

Menu item shortcuts can be customized in
`Tools-&gt;Global Options-&gt;Shortcuts'.<p>

Some notes about the key binding editor:

<ul>
<li>The key bindings are specified as described in the first section of
this file - <i>modifiers</i>+<i>key</i>
<li>The modifiers is optional - so for example you can bind to function
keys, etc
<li>Each key binding can consist of up to two key strokes
<li>To reset to the default keys, you must delete your .jedit-props
file, or if you don't want to lose your settings, open it with a
text editor and remove all <i>xxx</i>.shortcut entires
</ul>
