<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

This file describes jEdit's most basic functions. It assumes you are
familiar with simple text editing concepts (the caret, selecting text, etc).

<a name=starting>
<h1>Starting jEdit</h1>
</a>

jEdit can be started from a GUI or command line with no parameters,
in which case it will either open any files that were open in the last
session, or if the `save desktop' feature is disabled, a blank
`Untitled' file.<p>

jEdit can also be started from the command line to edit one or more
files like this:

<blockquote><code>jedit <i>file1</i> <i>file2</i>...</code></blockquote>

If the file name contains a hash (#) the remainder of the file name
after the hash character is the name of a marker that will be jumped to.
(See the <a href=advanced.html#markers>Markers</a> help topic for more
information.)<p>

A number of `switches' can also be passed to jEdit.

<blockquote><code>
	-version: Display jEdit version and exit<br>
	-usage: Display a command line usage message and exit<br>
	-nousrprops: Don't load user properties<br>
	-nohistory: Don't load history lists<br>
	-noserver: Don't start server<br>
	-nodesktop: Ignore saved desktop<br>
	-nosplash: Don't show initial splash screen<br>
	-usrprops=<i>file</i>: Load user properties from <i>file</i><br>
	-history=<i>file</i>: Load history lists from <i>file</i><br>
	-portfile=<i>file</i>: Save server port to <i>file</i><br>
	-desktopfile=<i>file</i>: Save desktop to <i>file</i><br>
	-readonly: Open files read only<br>
	-+<i>line</i>: Go to line number <i>line</i> of opened file<br>
	--: End of options<br>
</code></blockquote>

Because the `-' character is used for switches, you must enter the
`--' parameter prior to any file names that start with `-'.

<blockquote><code>jedit -- -filename</code></blockquote>

<a name=opening>
<h1>Opening Files</h1>
</a>

Once jEdit is started, additional files can be opened in a number of ways:

<ul>
<li><b>By starting another copy of jEdit.</b> -
if jEdit is started when there is another copy running, the files are opened in
the already running copy.
<li><b>With the `File->Open File' command.</b> - This displays a standard
file selection dialog box.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Open URL' command.</b> - This displays a text
entry dialog where a URL can be entered. The name `Open URL' is somewhat
misleading, since file names, as well as URLs, can be entered. The
exact protocols available depend on the Java implementation - most support
<code>ftp:</code>, <code>http:</code> and <code>file:</code>.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Open Selection' command.</b> - This opens the file
or URL specified by the currently selected text.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Open Recent' menu. </b>- This menu displays
the most recently opened files, 8 by default but this can be changed in
`File-&gt;Global Options-&gt;General'.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;New File' command.</b> - This command creates an
empty file named `Untitled-<i>n</i>' where <i>n</i> is the number of `Untitled'
files open so far. The new file isn't actually created on disk until you save;
see below.
</ul>

<a name=saving>
<h1>Saving Files</h1>
</a>

Any changes made to open files aren't actually stored to disk until you
save. (But see below about the auto save feature). To save the file to
disk, do one of the following:

<ul>
<li><b>Close the file or exit jEdit.</b> - If you close a file or exit jEdit,
you will be asked if any unsaved changes should be saved.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Save' command.</b> - This command saves the file
to disk without further user input. If the file is `Untitled', you will
be prompted to enter a file name first.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Save As' command.</b> - This command displays a
file selection dialog box where an alternative path name to save the file to
can be entered or selected.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Save to URL' command.</b> - This command displays
a text entry dialog box where a URL to save the file to can be entered.
As with `Open URL', file path names are accepted too. The available protocols
and the exact behaviour of URL uploading depend on the Java implementation.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Save All Buffers' command.</b> - This command saves
all open files to disk.
</ul>

<h2>Autosave</h2>

If jEdit crashes, there is still a good chance that you will be able
to recover any unsaved changes.<p>

Every 15 seconds (the interval can be changed in
`File-&gt;Global Options-&gt;General') a copy of every open file with unsaved
changes is written out to #<i>filename</i># where <i>filename</i> is the name
of the file. If jEdit crashes (or you do a file listing in a directory
which contains files open in jEdit) you will see these autosave files.<p>

If jEdit has truly crashed, try opening these autosave files
to see if they contain what was being edited before jEdit crashed. If
so, overwrite the original copy of the file with the autosave.<p>

<h2>Backups</h2>

Sometimes you start editing a file, save it several times, then decide
that you don't like the changes.<p>

The first time you save a file after opening it, jEdit copies the old
version to <i>filename</i>~ where <i>filename</i> is the name of the file being
saved. The result is that the backup always contains the file, as it was
before you started editing it.<p>

Multiple backups (named <i>filename</i>~1~, <i>filename</i>~2~,
<i>filename</i>~3~ and so on) can be enabled `File-&gt;Global Options-&gt;General'.

<a name=sendPrint>
<h1>Sending and Printing Files</h1>
</a>

Files can be sent via e-mail with the `File-&gt;Send' command.
`File-&gt;Print' can be used to print the file to a printer.

<a name=clipboard>
<h1>Cut, Copy and Paste</h1>
</a>

jEdit has several commands for moving and copying text. They are:

<ul>
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Cut</b> - this command places the selection in the
clipboard and removes it from the document.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Copy</b> - this command places the selection in the
clipboard and leaves it in the document.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Paste</b> - places the clipboard contents in the
document, replacing the selection, if any.
</ul>

<a name=undo>
<h1>Undo and Redo</h1>
</a>

In case you make a mistake, the `Edit-&gt;Undo' command undoes the last
editing action. Up to 100 previous actions can be undone. If you undo
too much, try `Edit-&gt;Redo'.

<a name=views>
<h1>Using Multiple Editor Windows</h1>
</a>

By default, jEdit has only one editor window, or <i>view</i>, open. All
open files, or <i>buffers</i> are opened in that view. However, new views
can be created with the `File-&gt;New View' command, and they can be
closed with `File-&gt;Close View'. The `Buffers' menu can be used to select
which buffer the current view is to edit. Several views can be editing the
same buffer, in which case changes in one view will propagate to all others
editing the same buffer.
