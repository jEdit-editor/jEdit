<h1>What is jEdit</h1>
</a>

jEdit is an Open Source, cross platform text editor written in Java. It is
NOT a word
processor - it doesn't support styled text. Instead, it can be used for
editing plain text files, such as HTML, Java source, Perl scripts, LaTeX
documents, and so on. It has many commands useful for the editing of
such files.<p>

jEdit uses gnu.regexp by the Free Software Foundation. Only the parts of
gnu.regexp used by jEdit are included - the complete package can be
found at &lt;http://www.cacas.org/java/gnu/regexp/&gt;.
