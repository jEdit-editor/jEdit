<h1>Version 1.7pre6</h1>
</a>

<h2>API Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The various bracket matching routines scattered around the code have been
merged into a single TextUtilities.findMatchingBracket()
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>The busy cursor is now displayed while loading the options dialog box
(which can take a while)
<li>The key binding editor can now change text area key bindings
(caret movement commands, page up, page down, etc)
<li>You can now use S+PageUp/S+PageDown to select screenfuls of text
<li>Minor tweaks to the HOME and END keys
<li>Literal search and replace is now performed faster
<li>Scrolling by screenfuls (with PageUp/PageDown, for example) is now
performed faster
<li>Files are saved a bit faster
<li>Javadocs are now provided for the text area classes
<li>jEdit can be started with the -quit switch to exit the currently
running instance using RMI (this is primarily of use to session
managers and the like)
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>`make clean' left behind unnecessary files in the remote package
<li>Changing the font of the text area didn't work properly until jEdit
was restarted
<li>Scrolling and repainting problems would manifest when making changes
at the end of the document
<li>The END key could throw an exception if the entire document was
visible on the viewscreen
<li>The buffer list set works better with find next
<li>Multiline tokens were not correctly colorized sometimes
<li>When switching to a buffer for the first time, the scroll bar wasn't
updated
<li>Double clicking on an empty line would throw an exception
<li>Scrolling didn't work with JDK 1.2. A workaround can be enabled in
File-&gt;Global Options-&gt;General (it is on by default, but those using
JDK 1.1 can turn it off for slightly faster scrolling)
<li>Editing multiline tokens at the end of the document could throw
NullPointerExceptions
<li>HTML mode didn't currectly colorize /* */ comments in
&lt;script&gt; tags
<li>Batch file could create invalid tokens under certain circumstances
<li>The shortcut and style option panes didn't update their tables properly
<li>Text area was created too wide
<li>Scrolling was very slow (and it didn't work at all if the blinking
caret was disabled)
<li>The latest version plugin would check for a new version even if `no' was
specified
</ul>

<a name=17pre5>
<h1>Version 1.7pre5</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>The text component has been completely rewritten:
<ul>
<li>No more problems with files &gt; 2000 lines
<li>Overwrite mode now works on Windows JDK 1.2
<li>It is faster than the old Swing-based component
<li>It can optionally display end-of-line markers
<li>It supports Brief-like HOME/END behaviour: press HOME once, and it
goes to the start of the line, press it twice it goes to the first visible
line, press it three times it goes to the beginning of the document
<li>It supports CodeWarrior-like double-click behaviour: double clicking on
a bracket will select the code block delimited by that bracket
<li>Double clicks now treat `.' as a word separator, unlike the old Swing
based code (which was very annoying when editing Java source)
<li>It is now possible to Shift-click to extend the selection
<li>The up/down arrows now behave better
</ul>
<li>It is now possible to disable window geometry saving. While this should
be enabled in most situations, it causes problems with some JVMs
</ul>

<h2>API Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Because of the text component rewrite, most code that manipulates text will
have to be changed
<li>getText() removed from RemoteBuffer interface (for security)
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Syntax coloring optimizations
<li>Documentation is no longer part of the jEdit JAR file - it is installed
separately
<li>More detailed RMI docs included
<li>It is no longer necessary to start rmiregistry with a -classpath
parameter pointing to jEdit's JAR file
<li>Changed exit shortcut from C+q to C+e C+q so that if you miss C+w
(close file) you can't accidentally exit the editor
<li>The busy cursor is now display while loading and saving files, and
several other time-consuming operations
<li>Minor LatestVersion tweaks
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Buffer.java, View.java and PerlTokenMarker.java didn't compile with javac
<li>Shell script and Makefile mode had minor problems coloring
multiline string literals
<li>Pasting text now works correctly with the MacOS MRJ
<li>SyntaxUtilities.regionMatches() had a minor problem, some syntax modes
were affected
<li>Error messages about invalid markers are no longer printed to standard
output. Previously, a stream of errors would be displayed when the latest
version plugin is being run
<li>Color picker dialogs were displayed twice in the colors &amp; styles
option pane
</ul>

<a name=17pre4>
<h1>Version 1.7pre4</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Featuress</h2>

<ul>
<li>The colors &amp; styles option pane is now finished
<li>Automatic upgrade notification: jEdit will now periodically connect
to a server and check if a newer release of jEdit is available
<li>Old socket-based server replaced with new RMI-based system. This has
a number of advantages over the old system:
<ul>
<li>Other applications can remotely control jEdit
<li>Clients can now wait for the buffers they opened to be closed
(jedit implements this with the -wait switch)
<li>RMI is well documented, in contrast to the poor server protocol old
jEdit versions used
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>jEdit configuration files (.jedit-props, .jedit-history) are now
stored in a .jedit subdirectory of the user's home directory. This
reduces clutter in the home directory.<p>
If you want to preserve your old
settings in 1.7pre4, you will have to rename the following files:
<ul>
<li>.jedit-props to .jedit/properties
<li>.jedit-history to .jedit/history
<li>.jedit-jars to .jedit/jars
<li>Any other files (.jedit-desktop, .jedit-server-*) can be
deleted because they are only used by obsolete versions of jEdit
</ul>
<li>`Save All Buffers' now asks for confirmation because saving all
buffers
<li>Buffers and views are now stored in a link list; some of jEdit's
internals are now a little cleaner
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Multiple files could be selected in the `Open File' dialog, even
though only the first one would be opened. Real multiple file opening
will be added as soon as Swing is fixed
</ul>

<a name=17pre3>
<h1>Version 1.7pre3</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Syntax coloring now highlights tokens with text styles (bold, italic)
as well as colors
<li>Plugin option panes are now displayed in a separate
`File-&gt;Plugin Options' dialog box
<li>`Find Next' now supports multi-file searching
<li>New `Search-&gt;Multifile Search Settings' command
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>When a line is clicked on in HyperSearch, the actual found text is
selected, rather than the entire line
<li>Documentation updates
<li>Instead of one huge makefile, there now is one makefile per directory
<li>Replace All is faster
</ul>

<h2>API Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>SyntaxDocument.set/getColors() changed to set/getStyles()
<li>Compound edit can now be nested
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Perl mode now colorizes much better
<li>Plugins now run when jEdit was loaded with a non-standard class loader
(Patrick Beard &lt;beard@netscape.com&gt;)
<li>If you select `Search in Selected Buffers' in the find dialog, but don't
select any buffers, jEdit will default to searching in the current buffer
<li>The geometry of the find and HyperSearch dialogs wasn't being saved
<li>Removed doc/users-guide/console.html file (the console is now a
plugin, seprate from jEdit)
</ul>

<a name=17pre2>
<h1>Version 1.7pre2</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Perl mode added (slightly flimsy, might be slow)
<li>Multifile search and replace started
(only `Replace All' and HyperSearch use the multifile code right now)
<li>`HyperSearch For Selection' command added (Mike Dillon)
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Minor syntax coloring optimizations
<li>Syntax coloring package is now released under the <b>GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL)</b>. Currently, no other part of jEdit
uses this license, only the syntax package
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Removed debugging message from shell script mode
<li>Property file mode didn't support commenting
<li>HyperSearch didn't have an `ignore case' toggle
<li>Expand abbreviation only worked when the caret was on the end of the line
<li>Saving an `Untitled' file didn't update the `Buffers' menu properly
<li>Autosave didn't work *at all* - it has been broken since some 1.6 release
<li>The state of the regular expression toggle wasn't saved properly
(Mike Dillon)
</ul>

<a name=17pre1>
<h1>Version 1.7pre1</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Search and replace overhaul:
<ul>
<li>Replace command is gone, use Replace in Selection instead
<li>The regular expression syntax can no longer be set; it is always
Perl5 now
<li>Literal search is now supported
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>WWW Browser commands unbundled into a `WWW Browser' plugin (with
more features)
<li>Console unbundled into a `Console' plugin (with more features)
<li>Rot13 and Reverse rolled into Mike Dillon's TextTools plugin
<li>(all these plugins are downloadable from
&lt;http://www.icg-online.de/jedit/&gt;.)
<li>Menubar rearranged
<li>Documentation updates
</ul>

<h2>API Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>MiscUtilities.createWhiteSpace(int length, int tabSize, boolean noTabs)
changed to MiscUtilities.createWhiteSpace(int length, int tabSize). To use
soft tabs, 0 should be passed as as `tabSize'.
<li>GUIUtilities.message/error/input/inputProperty() methods changed to
take a Frame as a parameter, instead of a JFrame
<li>Because the console is no longer part of jEdit, and instead a plugin,
other plugins that use it will have to be changed
<li>Any code using jEdit's search and replace code will have to be
rewritten
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Soft tabs now go to the next tab stop, rather than always inserting a
fixed number of spaces
<li>Sometimes multiline tokens weren't repainted properly
<li>C mode had problems coloring * characters
</ul>
