<h1>Version History</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href=#17pre1>Version 1.7pre1</a>
</ul>

<a name=17pre1>
<h1>Version 1.7pre1</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Search and replace overhaul:
<ul>
<li>Replace command is gone, use Replace in Selection instead
<li>The regular expression syntax can no longer be set; it is always
Perl5 now
<li>Literal search is now supported
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>WWW Browser commands unbundled into a `WWW Browser' plugin (with
more features)
<li>Console unbundled into a `Console' plugin (with more features)
<li>Rot13 and Reverse rolled into Mike Dillon's TextTools plugin
<li>(all these plugins are downloadable from
&lt;http://www.icg-online.de/jedit/&gt;.)
<li>Menubar rearranged
<li>Documentation updates
</ul>

<h2>API Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>MiscUtilities.createWhiteSpace(int length, int tabSize, boolean noTabs)
changed to MiscUtilities.createWhiteSpace(int length, int tabSize). To use
soft tabs, 0 should be passed as as `tabSize'.
<li>GUIUtilities.message/error/input/inputProperty() methods changed to
take a Frame as a parameter, instead of a JFrame
<li>Because the console is no longer part of jEdit, and instead a plugin,
other plugins that use it will have to be changed
<li>Any code using jEdit's search and replace code will have to be
rewritten
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Soft tabs now go to the next tab stop, rather than always inserting a
fixed number of spaces
<li>Sometimes multiline tokens weren't repainted properly
<li>C mode had problems coloring * characters
</ul>
