<ul>
<li><a href=#17pre5>Version 1.7pre5</a>
<li><a href=#17pre4>Version 1.7pre4</a>
<li><a href=#17pre3>Version 1.7pre3</a>

</ul>

<a name=17pre5>
<h1>Version 1.7pre5</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>It is now possible to disable window geometry saving. While this should
be enabled in most situations, it causes problems with some JVMs
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Syntax coloring optimizations
<li>Documentation is no longer part of the jEdit JAR file - it is installed
separately
<li>More detailed RMI docs included
<li>It is no longer necessary to start rmiregistry with a -classpath
parameter pointing to jEdit's JAR file
<li>Removed getText() from RemoteBuffer interface
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Buffer.java and View.java didn't compile with javac
<li>Shell script and Makefile mode had minor problems coloring
multiline string literals
</ul>

<a name=17pre4>
<h1>Version 1.7pre4</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Featuress</h2>

<ul>
<li>The colors &amp; styles option pane is now finished
<li>Automatic upgrade notification: jEdit will now periodically connect
to a server and check if a newer release of jEdit is available
<li>Old socket-based server replaced with new RMI-based system. This has
a number of advantages over the old system:
<ul>
<li>Other applications can remotely control jEdit
<li>Clients can now wait for the buffers they opened to be closed
(jedit implements this with the -wait switch)
<li>RMI is well documented, in contrast to the poor server protocol old
jEdit versions used
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>jEdit configuration files (.jedit-props, .jedit-history) are now
stored in a .jedit subdirectory of the user's home directory. This
reduces clutter in the home directory.<p>
If you want to preserve your old
settings in 1.7pre4, you will have to rename the following files:
<ul>
<li>.jedit-props to .jedit/properties
<li>.jedit-history to .jedit/history
<li>.jedit-jars to .jedit/jars
<li>Any other files (.jedit-desktop, .jedit-server-*) can be
deleted because they are only used by obsolete versions of jEdit
</ul>
<li>`Save All Buffers' now asks for confirmation because saving all
buffers
<li>Buffers and views are now stored in a link list; some of jEdit's
internals are now a little cleaner
<li>Multiple files can now be selected and opened in the `Open File'
dialog
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Multiple files could be selected in the `Open File' dialog, even
though only the first one would be opened. Real multiple file opening
will be added as soon as Swing is fixed
</ul>

<a name=17pre3>
<h1>Version 1.7pre3</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Syntax coloring now highlights tokens with text styles (bold, italic)
as well as colors
<li>Plugin option panes are now displayed in a separate
`File-&gt;Plugin Options' dialog box
<li>`Find Next' now supports multi-file searching
<li>New `Search-&gt;Multifile Search Settings' command
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>When a line is clicked on in HyperSearch, the actual found text is
selected, rather than the entire line
<li>Documentation updates
<li>Instead of one huge makefile, there now is one makefile per directory
<li>Replace All is faster
</ul>

<h2>API Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>SyntaxDocument.set/getColors() changed to set/getStyles()
<li>Compound edit can now be nested
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Perl mode now colorizes much better
<li>Plugins now run when jEdit was loaded with a non-standard class loader
(Patrick Beard &lt;beard@netscape.com&gt;)
<li>If you select `Search in Selected Buffers' in the find dialog, but don't
select any buffers, jEdit will default to searching in the current buffer
<li>The geometry of the find and HyperSearch dialogs wasn't being saved
<li>Removed doc/users-guide/console.html file (the console is now a
plugin, seprate from jEdit)
</ul>

<a name=17pre2>
<h1>Version 1.7pre2</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Perl mode added (slightly flimsy, might be slow)
<li>Multifile search and replace started
(only `Replace All' and HyperSearch use the multifile code right now)
<li>`HyperSearch For Selection' command added (Mike Dillon)
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Minor syntax coloring optimizations
<li>Syntax coloring package is now released under the <b>GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL)</b>. Currently, no other part of jEdit
uses this license, only the syntax package
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Removed debugging message from shell script mode
<li>Property file mode didn't support commenting
<li>HyperSearch didn't have an `ignore case' toggle
<li>Expand abbreviation only worked when the caret was on the end of the line
<li>Saving an `Untitled' file didn't update the `Buffers' menu properly
<li>Autosave didn't work *at all* - it has been broken since some 1.6 release
<li>The state of the regular expression toggle wasn't saved properly
(Mike Dillon)
</ul>

<a name=17pre1>
<h1>Version 1.7pre1</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Search and replace overhaul:
<ul>
<li>Replace command is gone, use Replace in Selection instead
<li>The regular expression syntax can no longer be set; it is always
Perl5 now
<li>Literal search is now supported
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>WWW Browser commands unbundled into a `WWW Browser' plugin (with
more features)
<li>Console unbundled into a `Console' plugin (with more features)
<li>Rot13 and Reverse rolled into Mike Dillon's TextTools plugin
<li>(all these plugins are downloadable from
&lt;http://www.icg-online.de/jedit/&gt;.)
<li>Menubar rearranged
<li>Documentation updates
</ul>

<h2>API Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>MiscUtilities.createWhiteSpace(int length, int tabSize, boolean noTabs)
changed to MiscUtilities.createWhiteSpace(int length, int tabSize). To use
soft tabs, 0 should be passed as as `tabSize'.
<li>GUIUtilities.message/error/input/inputProperty() methods changed to
take a Frame as a parameter, instead of a JFrame
<li>Because the console is no longer part of jEdit, and instead a plugin,
other plugins that use it will have to be changed
<li>Any code using jEdit's search and replace code will have to be
rewritten
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Soft tabs now go to the next tab stop, rather than always inserting a
fixed number of spaces
<li>Sometimes multiline tokens weren't repainted properly
<li>C mode had problems coloring * characters
</ul>
