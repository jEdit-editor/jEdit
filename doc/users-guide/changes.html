<h1>Version 1.6pre6</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Plugins can now use classes from other loaded plugins
<li>Plugins can now specify the jEdit/JDK version and any classes they
depend on
<li>History combo boxes are now text fields, with up/down arrow key
recall as in jEdit 1.4. Also, pressing Control with up/down will search
in the appropriate direction for entires starting with the currently
entered text
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>API change:</b> jEdit.VERSION and jEdit.BUILD renamed to
jEdit.getVersion() and jEdit.getBuild()
<li>Updated to gnu.regexp 1.0.8
<li>FAQ updated
<li>Splash screen is hidden if a dialog box is displayed at startup
(for example, a file not found message)
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>SyntaxTextArea.java didn't compile with javac
<li>Loaded JARs don't have to contain a Plugin instance for resource
loading to work
<li>JARClassLoader no longer attempts to instantiate abstract classes and
interfaces whose names end with `Plugin'
<li>The values of View.TOP and View.BOTTOM were incorrect, so the toolbar
API didn't work properly
</ul>

<a name=16pre5>
<h1>Version 1.6pre5</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Keyboard shortcut editor in Global Options

method
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>New methods in SyntaxTextArea that delegate to the underlying
SyntaxDocument
<li>Text components using SyntaxEditorKit now must have a document
that implements SyntaxDocument; this leads to simpler code
<li>New focusOnTextArea() method in View class sets focus on text area
<li>Minor optimizations in SyntaxTextArea
<li>`.sqlj' files now edited in Java mode
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>

</ul>

<a name=16pre4>
<h1>Version 1.6pre4</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pressing the Insert key should now toggle overwrite mode. This
only works in the main text component. This feature obsoletes, and
conflicts with the old AltGrPatch plugin. That plugin is no longer
bundled with jEdit; however, it might be left behind from an
old installation. When installing 1.6pre4 make sure to delete
any copies of altgr.jar.
<li>When opening a multiline token, subsequent lines are colorized
correctly automatically
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Multiline literals (&gt;&gt;EOF) are colorized in shell script
mode
<li>Console now displays command exit status
<li>Resource loader updates: it now tries to find the resource in
the system class loader if it could not be found in the plugin JAR
<li>New addComponent() methods in OptionPane class make it easier
to add components to the option pane
<li>Added check to EventMulticaster class to ensure that listeners
aren't added/removed from inside the fire() method (this limitation
will be removed in the future)
<li>The TokenMarker.lineInfo[] array is now guaranteed to contain
LineInfo objects for all valid lines
<li><code>KeywordMap(boolean ignoreCase, int mapLength)</code>
constructor of KeywordMap class is now public
</ul>

<a name=16pre3>
<h1>Version 1.6pre3</h1>
</a>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Major reworking of history list engine:
<ul>
<li>History lists are now saved to a seprate file ($HOME/.jedit-history).
Loading this file is much faster than loading hundreds of properties
<li>History lists are now shared. For example, a command entered into the
console of one view will appear in the history lists of all open views
<li>The clipboard history is stored using this method as well
</ul>
<li>New LineInfo class allows token markers to store whatever they want in the
TokenMarker.lineInfo[] array

colorized differently in the console
</ul>

<li>Minor updates to select line range and goto line commands
<li>Acu plugin is no longer part of jEdit, and instead it is listed on
Plugin Central
</ul>

desktop correctly

than the current one and the caret was at the end of the document

with the jEdit.addOptionPane() method

error parsing feature
</ul>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>API change:</b> Plugin.start() called near the end of jEdit's
startup sequence
<li><b>Syntax colorizing change:</b> Token.LITERAL1 should be used for
string literals, Token.LITERAL2 for object literals (eg, null, true, false,
