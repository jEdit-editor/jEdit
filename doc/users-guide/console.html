<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

To make it easier to execute external programs such as compilers, each view
has a built in `console' component that does exactly that. An error parsing
system also exists to make the compile-edit-fix cycle faster.

<a name=general>
<h1>General Information</h1>
</a>

The console can be shown and hidden by dragging the patterned bar underneath
the toolbar, or by invoking `Tools-&gt;Show/Hide Console'.<p>

The console consists of a command text field, an output
tab that lists the output of each command, and an errors tab that lists any
parsed errors. Pressing enter in the command field will execute the
currently entered command.<p>

The console displays lines of text in different colors depending if they
are informational messages (those printed by the console), errors
(text output on the error stream of the running process), or parsed
errors (more on that later). The colors used by the console
can be changed in `Tools-&gt;Global Options-&gt;Colors'.<p>

The following variables can be entered as part of the command:

<ul>
<li>%d - expands to the current file's parent directory
<li>%f - expands to the current file's full path
<li>%j - expands to the directory where jEdit is installed
<li>%% - expands to the % character
</ul>

In addition to commands, URLs can also be entered - try entering
`file:C:\autoexec.bat' or similar for jEdit to open that file.<p>

Finally, entering `clear' will remove all text from the console.

<a name=errors>
<h1>Error Parsing</h1>
</a>

While a command is running, jEdit attempts to parse any errors it outputs.
Currently, jEdit parses the following error formats:
<ul>
<li>Generic format used by many compilers and utilities:
<blockquote><code>file name:line number:error message</code></blockquote>
<lI>Emacs format used by Jikes Java compiler and several others:
<blockquote><code>
file name:line number:column number:end line number:end column number:<br>
error message</code></blockquote>
<li>TeX-style errors:
<blockquote><code>
! error message<br>
l.line number, error message continued
</code></blockquote>
</ul>

Selecting an error in the errors tab will open the file involved and move the
caret to the line where the error occurred. The `Tools-&gt;Next Error' and
`Tools-&gt;Previous Error' commands can also be used to go to the next and
the previous error, respectively.

<a name=compiler>
<h1>Invoking Mode-Specific Compilers</h1>
</a>

The `Tools-&gt;Compile' command invokes
a mode specific compiler - for example, in C mode, this is cc, in Java
this is javac, etc.<p>

The compiler can also be set on a file-by-file basis by setting the
`compiler' buffer-local property, for example by putting this in one of
the first 10 lines of the file:
<blockquote><code>:compiler=c89 -O2 %f:</code></blockquote>
Of course c89 -O2 should be replaced by your compiler and compilation flags,
if any. The %f should appear somewhere in the compiler command - it is
replaced with the file's path name by the console.
</ul>
