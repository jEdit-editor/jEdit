<a name=textarea>
<h1>New Text Component</h1>
</a>

The text component has been rewritten more-or-less from scratch. Instead of
being based on the Swing JEditorPane, it is a competely new, lightweight,
implementation. The main benefits are:

<ul>
<li><b>Speed</b> - the Swing JEditorPane has lots of unnecessary overhead,
which is now bypassed
<li><b>Stability</b> - the Swing code was rather buggy. With jEdit 1.7, files
longer than 2000 lines can now be edited, and overwrite mode works on Windows
<li><b>Features</b> - the new text component has many more features, such as
smarter keyboard actions, better double-click behaviour, etc.
<li><b>Customizability</b> - plugins can be written which provide emulations
for other editors (for example, VI), also the text area built in key bindings
(arrow keys, Home, End) can now be changed
</ul>

<a name=syntax>
<h1>Syntax Highlighting Updates</h1>
</a>

The syntax highlighting system has undergone the following changes:

<ul>
<li><b>Perl mode</b> - A Perl editing mode has been added
<li><b>Styles</b> - text styles (bold, italic) in addition to colors, are now used
to mark tokens
<li><b>Speed</b> - Several token markers have been rewritten for speed, and various
tweaks were made which improve performance throughout
</ul>

<a name=search>
<h1>Search And Replace Updates</h1>
</a>

The search and replace code has been overhauled. Literal (no regexp) search
and multifile searching is now supported.

<a name=rmi>
<h1>RMI Interface</h1>
</a>

The old socket-based server has been replaced with an RMI-based system that
allows for much finer remote control of jEdit. Other applications can now
remotely control jEdit, along with several more minor improvements.

<a name=lgpl>
<h1>Components Licensed Under the LGPL</h1>
</a>

jEdit's syntax highlighting package is now released under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL), allowing it to be linked into non-Open Source
programs, provided those programs distribute the source to the syntax package,
along with any changes they made.<p>

The text area component and RMI interfaces, which are new in 1.7, are also
released under the LGPL.

<a name=other>
<h1>Other Enhancements</h1>
</a>

Some of the less significant changes in 1.7 are:

<ul>
<li>A plugin is now included that periodically checks if a newer version
of jEdit is available, and if so, informs the user and optionally displays
the change log (this can be disabled)
<li>The console and WWW browser commands have been repackaged as plugins,
and are now distributed separately from jEdit. They can be downloaded from
Plugin Central &lt;http://www.icg-online.de/jedit&gt;.
<li>The busy/wait cursor is displayed while performing lengthy operations
<li>jEdit's configuration files are now stored in a .jedit subdirectory of
the user's home directory. To retain your previous settings, move the following
files as follows:
<ul>
<li>$HOME/.jedit-props to $HOME/.jedit/properties
<li>$HOME/.jedit-history to $HOME/.jedit/history
<li>$HOME/.jedit-jars to $HOME/.jedit/jars
<li>(other files such as .jedit-desktop and .jedit-server-* can be deleted
because they are only used by older versions of jEdit)
</ul>
