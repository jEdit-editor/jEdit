<td>To do:
<ul>
<li>jEdit has been through 8 major revisions, and since version 1.0
it has quadrupled in size... so all the bloat and dead code needs
to be removed, and the old code needs to be overhauled and made more
compact:
<ul>
<li>Menus should be loaded from an XML file, with a TurboNotes like
MenuBarModel and ToolBarModel
<li>XML files should be used instead of properties (with properties, lots
of stuff is stored twice, for example the recent file list is stored once
in the properties, and also in the recent vector. With XML, this can be
avoided)
<li>Rewrite C, HTML, TeX token markers to use PerlTokenMarker-like structure
<li>Ask Mike Dillon to do the same to TSQL if necessary
<li>Drop support for Swing &lt; 1.1 (removeAll() hack, maybe others)
<li>Eventually, switch to JDK 1.2 and add drag and drop, remove
deprecates, change RMI to CORBA, add im/bidi support, use collections, etc
</ul>

<li>Possible syntax package improvements:
<ul>
<li>Finish Perl mode (multiline s/// &amp; co)
<li>Token markers should be able to re-mark a specific region of the
document, instead of being limited to entire lines
<li>Tokens should be cached so that constant tokenizing isn't necessary
<li>XMode integration
<li>More speed is always needed
</ul>

<li>Possible text area improvements:
<ul>
<li>Folding
<li>Rectangular selection
<li>More speed is always needed
</ul>

<li>Possible core improvements:
<ul>
<li>Embeddability
<li>Macro language
<li>XML indent
<li>Piece content
</ul>

</ul>
