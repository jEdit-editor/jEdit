<li><a href=#longterm>Long Term</a>
</ul>

<a name=shortterm>
<h1>Short Term</h1>
</a>

This is what needs to be done as soon as possible:

<ul>
<li>Finish Perl mode (qw( (aaa) ), multiline matching)
<li>Faster literal search
<li>Finish StyleOptionPane
<li>!!! if a clip starts with &lt;html&gt;, Paste Previous/Predefined act
weird (how to turn of Swing's auto html?)
</ul>

<a name=medterm>
<h1>Medium Term</h1>
</a>

This is what needs to be done before 1.7final is released:

<ul>
<li>Port jEdit to Swing 1.1.1. It is a much better release
and this should be done as soon as 1.1.1 is released. The
following workarounds should be removed from jEdit:

<ul>
<li>The removeAll() hack in the View.update*Menu methods
<li>... maybe more?
</ul>

<li>Multiline token colorization needs some work.<p>
The C+END `bug' still exists. Changing a large range of lines still
messes up the display (and tokenizeLines() isn't appropriate in some
situations)

<li>Editor needs to be embeddable in other applications.<p>
There are several levels of integration that should be looked into:

<ul>
<li>jEdit as an editing service for other applications.<p>
This way, jEdit will still be a standalone application, but the
server will be extended to support notification of buffers being
closed and such. A simple client - a wrapper around the server
should also be written.

<li>jEdit as an editing service of other applications, running
inside that application.<p>
This way, jEdit will provide support for running inside another
application. An AppOwner or similar interface will provide
support for exiting, fetching properties, and so on.
</ul>

<li>Help viewer should support bookmarks.<p>
As more and more documentation is written, this becomes more of
an issue.

<li>Multi-line search patterns.<p>
This sort of works with searching; but it would be hard to implement
with replacement.

<li>All token markers should be rewritten to use the same structure
as PerlTokenMarker - they will be faster.
</ul>

<a name=longterm>
<h1>Long Term</h1>
</a>

This is what needs to be done eventually:

<ul>
<li>jEdit API needs to be made thread-safe.
<li>Class/method/variable completion.

<li>As it is right now, the toolbar is useless. It would be much handier
if:
<ul>
<li>It was customizable
<li>It was possible to add buttons that inserted predefined chunks of text,
a la Paste Predefined
</ul>
Since I don't like toolbars myself, this is better implemented as a plugin
- with the new 1.6 toolbar API, it is very easy.

<li>Folding.

<li>Integrate XMode.<p>
Mike Dillon's XMode is a much better way of writing syntax
modes than the current `manual' way.<p>

<li>Auto indent improvements.<p>
Auto indent should support `smart' indent (for example, shifting
the indent on the next line after an `if'). Also, it should line
up closing and opening brackets, instead of the current indent
shifting that does not always work correctly.<p>

Pressing keys such as {, } or : in C mode should invoke indentation
routines automatically.<p>

If we include XMode, we might as well get as much out of the
XML parser as possible- a simple way of specifying indentation
using XML should be supported.

<li>Macro language.<p>

Some operations are very tedious without a macro language.<p>

The following issues need to be considered:

<ul>
<li>What language?<p>
JPython, being quite complete, fast and easy
to learn is a good choice for this.

<li>What level of integration? Should it be a macro language only,
or should it integrate deeply with jEdit, with parts of the editor
written in this language?<p>

If we choose to do full integration, actions can be eliminated,
being replaced by short prodedures in that language.<p>

If we choose to keep actions, how should they be invoked from the
language? As functions? With a special wrapper?

<li>Should properties be obsoleted?<p>
Manual calls to jEdit.setProperty(), or global variables in that
language can be used instead. No need to parse two different
file types at startup.

<li>Should the Java-based plugin API be obsoleted?<p>
This is unlikely,
since the extension language will be slower and more limited than
pure Java, no matter what we do. Also, installing a .jar is much
easier than a whole bunch of .py or whatever files.
</ul>

<li>Piece content.<p>
Mike Dillon once said he was planning on implementing a piece
content similar to one used in Microsoft Word and many other
programs.<p>

This will lead to faster autosave, better undo, and faster
editing in general.

</ul>
