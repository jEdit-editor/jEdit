<tr>
<td>1.7pre5</td>
<td>To do:
<ul>
<li>Scrolling doesn't work properly on JDK 1.2 (maybe it's a Linux JDK-pre bug)
<li>xToOffset() is broken
<li>Multi-file find next is severely broken
<li>Scrap electric scroll, instead do emacs-style jump scroll
<li>Do wait cursor in find-next and replace-selection
<li>Wait cursor isn't hidden properly when saving
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1.7pre6</td>
<td>To do:
<ul>
<li>Currently, jEdit has three very similar bracket matching routines
(locate-bracket action, JEditTextArea.updateBracketHighlight(),
JEditTextArea.MouseHandler.doDoubleClick()). They should be merged into
a single TextUtilities.getMatchingBracket(), and the lower half
TextUtilities.locateBracket{Forward,Backward} should be rewritten/scrapped
<li>Add text area actions to key binding editor
<li>Javadocs for text area classes
<li>Write TextArea.setDefaults(), then View.getTextAreaDefaults(),
then do it quicker in propertiesChanged()
<li>Faster literal search
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1.7pre7</td>
<td>To do:
<ul>
<li>Finish Perl mode (multiline matches)
<li>Rewrite token markers to use PerlTokenMarker-like structure<p>
<b>PARTLY DONE: need to do C, HTML, TeX</b><br>
<b>Mike D should do TSQL</b>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1.8 and beyond</td>
<td>To do:
<ul>
<li>Embeddability
<li>Folding
<li>Menu bar overhaul (EnhancedMenu/Bar classes, support getMenuByName(),
getMenuItemByName(), will make current dynamic menu system obsolete, will
also support loading menus for stuff other than views)
<li>Macro language
<li>XMode integration
<li>XML indent
<li>Piece content
<li>Drop support for Swing &lt; 1.1 (removeAll() hack, maybe others)
<li>Eventually, drop support for JDK 1.1 and add drag and drop, remove
deprecates, change RMI to CORBA, add im/bidi support, etc
<li>Use ALE or similar GUI language to code GUI?
<li>Token markers should be able to re-mark a specific region of the
document, instead of being limited to entire lines
<li>Rectangular selection
<li>It would be cool if when jEdit started, it displayed a button bar
with open file, new view, options, etc buttons. Then, jEdit would
stay open even if all views were closed
</ul>
