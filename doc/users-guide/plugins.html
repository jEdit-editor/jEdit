<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

jEdit has a powerful plugin architecture. Plugins can be used to add
almost any feature to jEdit. They are easy to write and even easier to
install.

<a name=finding>
<h1>Finding Plugins</h1>
</a>

The plugins included with jEdit are only for demonstrational purposes,
they don't do anything useful. Real plugins can be downloaded from
jEdit Plugin Central &lt;http://www.icg-online.de/jedit/&gt;.

<h1>Installing Plugins</h1>
</a>

Plugins are distributed as JAR files. They have a .jar extension.<p>

Plugins can be installed in one of two directories - the system plugin
directory and the user plugin directory. Plugins in the system directory
can be used by all users on the system. Plugins in a user's plugin
directory can only be used by the respective user.<p>

On Unix, the system plugin directory is
/usr/local/share/jedit-<i>version</i>/jars, Each user has a
plugin directory in $HOME/.jedit-jars.<p>

On Windows 95 and 98, the system plugin directory is C:\Program
Files\jEdit\jars. The user plugin directory is %JAVA_HOME%\.jedit-jars.<p>

On Windows NT, the system plugin directory is the same as that on
Windows 95/98, but each user has a plugin directory in
C:\Windows\Profiles\<i>USER</i>\.jedit-jars.

<a name=using>
<h1>Using Plugins</h1>
</a><p>

Once a plugin is installed, jEdit will say so during startup.

<blockquote><code>
	Scanning JAR file: /home/slava/.jedit-jars/BufferSelector.jar<br>
	-- loaded plugin: BufferSelectorPlugin
</code></blockquote>

If all goes well during startup, the plugins should appear in the
`Plugins' menu.<p>

Some plugins add option panes to the `File-&gt;Plugin Options' dialog box.

<a name=help>
<h1>Getting Help For Plugins</h1>
</a>

Well-behaved plugins should have an entry in
Help-&gt;Plugins Help Contents. It should contain
information about the plugin's use. You can jump to the plugin
documentation directly by clicking <a href=jeditplugins:>
here</a>.
