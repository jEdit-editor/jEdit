<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

jEdit has a powerful plugin architecture. Plugins can be used to add
almost any feature to jEdit. They are easy to write and even easier to
install.

<h1>Installing Plugins</h1>
</a>

Plugins are distributed as JAR files. They have a .jar extension.<p>

Plugins can be installed in one of two directories - the system plugin
directory and the user plugin directory. Plugins in the system directory
can be used by all users on the system. Plugins in a user's plugin
directory can only be used by the respective user.<p>

On Unix, the system plugin directory is
/opt/slava/share/jedit-<i>version</i>/jars, Each user has a
plugin directory in $HOME/.jedit-jars.<p>

On Windows 95 and 98, the system plugin directory is C:\Program
Files\jEdit\jars. The user plugin directory is %JAVAHOME%\.jedit-jars.<p>

On Windows NT, the system plugin directory is the same as that on
Windows 95/98, but each user has a plugin directory in
%HOMEDIR%\.jedit-jars.

<h1>Using Plugins</h1>
</a><p>

Once a plugin is installed, jEdit will say so during startup.

<blockquote><code>
	Scanning JAR file: /home/slava/.jedit-jars/rot13.jar
	-- loaded plugin: Rot13Plugin
</code></blockquote>

If all goes well during startup, the plugins should also appear in the
`Plugins' menu.<p>

jEdit comes with several plugins that convert accented characters to HTML
entities and vice versa, reverse text, and rot13 text. They are installed
when jEdit is installed.

<h1>Getting Help For Plugins</h1>
</a>

Well-behaved plugins should have an entry in
Help-&gt;Plugins Help Contents. It should contain
information about the plugin's use. You can jump to the plugin
documentation directly by clicking <a href=jeditplugins:>
