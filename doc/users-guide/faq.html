<h1>How do I Change the Compiler Used by `Tools-&gt;Compile'?</h1>
</a>

This is detailed in the
<a href=console.html#compiler>Invoking Mode Specific Compilers</a>
help topic.

<a name=cd>
<h1>Why can't I change directories in the console?</h1>
</a>

At the moment, Java doesn't support changing the current working directory
(user.dir).

<a name=wincommands>
<h1>Why do certain commands not work in the console on Windows?</h1>
</a>

On Windows 95 and 98, some commands, such as dir, del, mkdir, type
and several others are internal to COMMAND.COM, the MS-DOS command
interpreter. To invoke them you must enter the following in the console:

<pre>
command.com /k <i>command</i>
</pre>

On Windows NT, the same commands are internal to CMD.EXE, the 32-bit
command interpreter. To invoke them you must enter the following in
the console:

<pre>
cmd /k <i>command</i>
</pre>

<a name=memory>
<h1>Why do I get OutOfMemoryErrors?</h1>
</a>

When you have lots of buffers open, there might not be enough free
space in the <i>Java heap</i>, even though lots of RAM is available.
The solution is to increase the Java heap memory allocation.<p>

On Windows, enter the following in an MS-DOS Prompt before starting jEdit,
or place it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT to have it done every time the
system starts:

<pre>
set JEDIT=-mx<i>nn</i>m
</pre>

On Unix systems with a Bourne shell (ash, bash, jsh, sh, zsh) enter
the following in a command line before starting jEdit, or place it in
your .login or .profile to have it done every time you log in:

<pre>
set JEDIT=-mx<i>nn</i>m; export JEDIT
</pre>

On Unix systems with a C shell (csh, tcsh) enter the following in a
command line before starting jEdit, or place it in your .csh.login
or .csh.profile to have it done every time you log in:

<pre>
setenv JEDIT -mx<i>nn</i>
</pre>

Where <i>nn</i> is the size of the Java heap, in megabytes. The
default is 32 Mb - if you like to open lots of files at once, 64
might be better.<p>

<a name=exithang>
<h1>Why does jEdit hang when exiting?</h1>
</a>

There is a bug in some JDKs where calling <code>ServerSocket.close()</code>
will hang the JVM. This is documented as bug 4107121 in the JDC bug
parade (see <code>http://developer.java.sun.com</code>).<p>

The only workaround is to disable the jEdit server in
`Tools-&gt;Global Options-&gt;General'.

<a name=bigfile>
<h1>Why does the display mess up when editing large files?</h1>
</a>

Due to an AWT limitation or Swing bug (or maybe both) the
Swing JTextComponent component has problems editing documents greater
than about 2000 lines. The problem is that the viewscreen turns gray
and GUI elements are repainted incorrectly. Until Sun fixes
this, other editors will have to be used to edit very large
files.

<a name=overwrite>
<h1>Why doesn't overwrite mode work?</h1>
</a>

Overwrite mode doesn't appear to work on Windows JDK 1.2. I am
working on a fix; it will be available as soon as possible.<p>

If overwrite mode doesn't work on other systems, the most likely
problem is that your jEdit is still loading the AltGrPatch plugin
that was obsoleted as of version 1.6pre4. Delete any copies of
altgr.jar from the system and user plugin directories (see the
<a href=plugins.html>jEdit Plugins</a> help topic for details).

<a name=altgr>
<h1>Why doesn't the AltGr key work?</h1>
</a>

JDK 1.1.7 and earlier had a bug where the AltGr key generated
the wrong keycode. Upgrade to JDK 1.1.8 or later to fix this
problem.

<a name=www>
<h1>Why doesn't the `Open in WWW Browser' command work?</h1>
</a>

On Unix and Windows, make sure that either the full path to
the browser is entered in `Tools-&gt;Global Options-&gt;General',
or that the browser's directory is listed in your PATH.<p>

On Unix, it is recommended that the `jedit_moz_remote' wrapper
for Netscape Navigator be used. The script relies on the `netscape'
executable being in the PATH.<p>

On the MacOS, the `Open in WWW Browser' feature does not work at
all. If anybody can confirm otherwise, I will be happy to post
information here.

<a name=alt>
<h1>Why don't the Alt key mnemonics work?</h1>
</a>

On some JDK versions, the AWT incorrectly sets the modifiers of
KEY_TYPED events to 0 even if the Alt key is pressed. The end
result is that the keystroke is inserted in the document. This
is an AWT bug, and as far as I know the only way to fix it is
to upgrade to a later JDK version.

<a name=slow>
<h1>Why is jEdit so slow?</h1>
</a>

Because jEdit is written in Java, it's performance will always be
slower than native applications. A fast system with a good JVM
will narrow the performance gap.<p>

On all systems, a speedup can be achieved by installing the latest
Swing version. Swing 1.1.1 seems to be much faster than either
Swing 1.1beta3 or Swing 1.1final.<p>

Installing more RAM may improve performance - more RAM will
result in less garbage collection.<p>

On Linux, try installing the TYA JIT
