<h1>JDK bugs that cause problems in jEdit</h1>
</a>

Before reporting a problem with jEdit, make sure it's not a JDK bug:

<ul>
<li>Bug #4060861 - not having your computer's host name assigned to
127.0.0.1 will cause RMI to throw an AccessException
(fixed in JDK 1.1.8 and 1.2beta3)
<li>Bug #4186108, maybe others - printing doesn't work very well with
JDK 1.2 (not yet fixed)
<li> Bug #4159610 - Alt key menu mnemonics insert the mnemonic character
into the text (only seems to occur with JDK 1.2, the bug parade
lists it as being fixed in a `non-public release', so it should appear in
a new JDK soon)
<li>Bug #4211210 - having more than about 2000 lines in a text area causes
problems (not yet fixed)
<li>Bug #4122687 - the AltGr key doesn't work (fixed in JDK 1.1.8 and 1.2)
<li>Bug ???? - overwrite mode doesn't work on JDK 1.2 (not present in JDK 1.1.x)
</ul>

<a name=console>
<h1>What happened to the console?</h1>
</a>

As of jEdit 1.7pre1, the console is a plugin distributed separately from
jEdit. Download it from &lt;http://www.icg-online.de/jedit/&gt;.

<a name=wwwbrowser>
<h1>What happened to the `Open in WWW Browser' command?</h1>
</a>

As of jEdit 1.7pre1, the `Open in WWW Browser' command is a plugin
distributed separately from jEdit. Download it from
&lt;http://www.icg-online.de/jedit/&gt;.

<a name=rot13>
<h1>What happened to the Rot13 and Reverse plugins?</h1>
</a>

You mean you actually *USE* them? As of jEdit 1.7pre1, Rot13 and Reverse
have been rolled into Mike Dillon's TextTools plugin, which is distributed
separately from jEdit. Download it from
&lt;http://www.icg-online.de/jedit/&gt;.

<a name=permissions>
<h1>Why are file permissions reset to the defaults when I save?</h1>
</a>

This occurs because of a Java limitation. The only workaround is to
disable backups in `File-&gt;Global Options'.

<a name=clipboard>
<h1>Why can't I copy and paste between jEdit and other applications?</h1>
</a>

If you're using jEdit on a Unix system, you will not be able to access
the `middle-mouse-button' cut buffer, only the Motif clipboard. This
is due to the way the JDK is implemented on Unix.<p>

A crude workaround is to use an application that supports both clipboards,
such as nedit, to transfer data.

<a name=memory>
<h1>Why do I get OutOfMemoryErrors?</h1>
</a>

When you have lots of buffers open, there might not be enough free
space in the <i>Java heap</i>, even though lots of RAM is available.
The solution is to increase the Java heap memory allocation.<p>

On Windows, enter the following in an MS-DOS Prompt before starting jEdit,
or place it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT to have it done every time the
system starts:

<pre>
set JEDIT=-mx<i>nn</i>m
</pre>

On Unix systems with a Bourne shell (ash, bash, jsh, sh, zsh) enter
the following in a command line before starting jEdit, or place it in
your .login or .profile to have it done every time you log in:

<pre>
set JEDIT=-mx<i>nn</i>m; export JEDIT
</pre>

On Unix systems with a C shell (csh, tcsh) enter the following in a
command line before starting jEdit, or place it in your .csh.login
or .csh.profile to have it done every time you log in:

<pre>
setenv JEDIT -mx<i>nn</i>
</pre>

Where <i>nn</i> is the size of the Java heap, in megabytes. The
default is 32 Mb - if you like to open lots of files at once, 64
might be better.<p>

Note that JDK 1.1.8 has a dynamic heap, so this is not necessary.

<a name=noswing>
<h1>Why do I get a ClassDefNotFoundError on startup?</h1>
</a>

If you get a ClassDefNotFoundError: org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.SplashScreen when
jEdit is starting up, the most likely problem is that you do not have
Swing installed properly. For jEdit to work, Swing 1.1beta3 or later
must be installed, and it's swingall.jar file must be in the CLASSPATH.<p>

Swing can be downloaded from &lt;java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html&gt;.

<a name=slow>
<h1>Why is jEdit so slow?</h1>
</a>

Because jEdit is written in Java, it's performance will always be
slower than native applications. A fast system with a good JVM
will narrow the performance gap.<p>

On all systems, a speedup can be achieved by installing the latest
Swing version. Swing 1.1.1 seems to be much faster than either
Swing 1.1beta3 or Swing 1.1final.<p>

Installing more RAM may improve performance - more RAM will
result in less garbage collection.<p>

On Linux, try installing the TYA JIT
