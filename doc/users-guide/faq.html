<h1>I get OutOfMemoryErrors even though I have lots of free RAM!</h1>
</a>

When you have lots of buffers open, there might not be enough free
space in the <i>Java heap</i>, even though lots of RAM is available.
The solution is to increase the Java heap memory allocation.<p>

On Windows, enter the following in an MS-DOS Prompt before starting jEdit,
or place it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT to have it done every time the
system starts:

<pre>
set JEDIT=-mx<i>nn</i>m
</pre>

On Unix systems with a Bourne shell (ash, bash, jsh, sh, zsh) enter
the following in a command line before starting jEdit, or place it in
your .login or .profile to have it done every time you log in:

<pre>
set JEDIT=-mx<i>nn</i>m; export JEDIT
</pre>

On Unix systems with a C shell (csh, tcsh) enter the following in a
command line before starting jEdit, or place it in your .csh.login
or .csh.profile to have it done every time you log in:

<pre>
setenv JEDIT -mx<i>nn</i>
</pre>

Where <i>nn</i> is the size of the Java heap, in megabytes. The
default is 32 Mb - if you like to open lots of files at once, 64
might be better.<p>

<h1>The Alt-key mnemonics act weird!</h1>
</a>

On some JDK versions, the AWT incorrectly sets the modifiers of
KEY_TYPED events to 0 even if the Alt key is pressed. The end
result is that the keystroke is inserted in the document. This
is an AWT bug, and as far as I know the only way to fix it is
to upgrade to a later JDK version.

<a name=www>
<h1>The `Open in WWW Browser' command doesn't work!</h1>
</a>

On Unix and Windows, make sure that either the full path to
the browser is entered in `Tools-&gt;Global Options-&gt;General',
or that the browser's directory is listed in your PATH.<p>

On Unix, it is recommended that the `jedit_moz_remote' wrapper
for Netscape Navigator be used. The script relies on the `netscape'
executable being in the PATH.<p>

On the MacOS, the `Open in WWW Browser' feature does not work. If
anybody can confirm otherwise, I will be happy to post information
here.

<a name=bigfile>
<h1>Why does the display mess up when editing large files?</h1>
</a>

Due to an AWT limitation or Swing bug (or maybe both) the
Swing JTextComponent component has problems editing documents greater
than about 2000 lines. The problem is that the viewscreen turns gray
and GUI elements are repainted incorrectly. Until Sun fixes
this, other editors will have to be used to edit very large
files.
