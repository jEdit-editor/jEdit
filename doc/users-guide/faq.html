<h1>I get OutOfMemoryErrors even though I have lots of free RAM!</h1>
</a>

When you have lots of buffers open, there might not be enough free
space in the <i>Java heap</i>, even though lots of RAM is available.
The solution is to increase the Java heap memory allocation.<p>

On Windows, enter this in an MS-DOS Prompt before starting jEdit,
or place it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT to have it done every time the
system starts:

<pre>
set JEDIT=-mx<i>nn</i>m
</pre>

Where <i>nn</i> is the size of the Java heap, in megabytes. The
default is 32 Mb - if you like to open lots of files at once, 64
might be better.<p>

On Unix, the procedure is the same - set the JEDIT enviroment
variable (how this is done depends on the shell) and if necessary,
place the command in your .profile or .cshprofile (depending on
what shell you are using).

<a name=alt>
<h1>The Alt-key mnemonics act weird!</h1>
</a>

On some JDK versions, pressing an Alt-key mnemonic inserts the
character in the text, rather than selecting the menu. This is
an AWT/JFC bug; there is nothing I can do about it. The only solution
is to upgrade to a more recent JDK version.

<a name=www>
<h1>The `Open in WWW Browser' command doesn't work!</h1>
</a>

On Unix, make sure that the browser is in your PATH. On Windows,
make sure that the browser's name ends with `.exe'. Also on some
systems it might be necessary to enter the full path to the
browser, not just the name of the executable.

<a name=multi>
<h1>Why aren't multiline comments, etc colorized correctly?</h1>
</a>

In jEdit, when you open a multiline comment, the rest of the
viewscreen isn't automatically colorized accordingly - you must
force a replaint, by scrolling up or down, or hiding and
exposing the jEdit window. This is a limitation of how jEdit
works, and it will be fixed in the near future. BTW, Emacs has
this problem too.

<a name=bigfile>
<h1>Why does the display mess up when editing large files?</h1>
</a>

Due to an AWT limitation or Swing bug (or maybe both) the
Swing JTextComponent component has problems editing documents
&gt; 2000 or so lines. The problem is that the viewscreen turns gray
and GUI elements are repainted incorrectly. Until Sun fixes
this, other editors will have to be used to edit very large
files.
