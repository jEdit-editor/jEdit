<a name=console>
<h1>What happened to the console?</h1>
</a>

As of jEdit 1.7pre1, the console is a plugin distributed separately from
jEdit. Download it from &lt;http://www.icg-online.de/jedit/&gt;.

<a name=wwwbrowser>
<h1>What happened to the `Open in WWW Browser' command?</h1>
</a>

As of jEdit 1.7pre1, the `Open in WWW Browser' command is a plugin
distributed separately from jEdit. Download it from
&lt;http://www.icg-online.de/jedit/&gt;.

<a name=rot13>
<h1>What happened to the Rot13 and Reverse plugins?</h1>
</a>

You mean you actually *USE* them? As of jEdit 1.7pre1, Rot13 and Reverse
have been rolled into Mike Dillon's TextTools plugin, which is distributed
separately from jEdit. Download it from
&lt;http://www.icg-online.de/jedit/&gt;.

<a name=bestjdk>
<h1>What is the best JDK/Swing version for jEdit?</h1>
</a>

jEdit runs best with JDK 1.1.8 and Swing 1.1.1beta2. It runs reasonably
well with JDK 1.2, but mainly because of JDK bugs, it has the following
problems:

<ul>
<li>Printing doesn't work
<li>Overwrite mode doesn't work
<li>C+HOME/C+END behave in a broken manner
<li>Alt-key mnemonics don't work properly
</ul>

Hopefully these will be fixed in a future JDK 1.2 release.

<a name=permissions>
<h1>Why are file permissions reset to the defaults when I save?</h1>
</a>

This occurs because of a Java limitation. The only workaround is to
disable backups in `File-&gt;Global Options'.

<a name=clipboard>
<h1>Why can't I copy and paste between jEdit and other applications?</h1>
</a>

If you're using jEdit on a Unix system, you will not be able to access
the `middle-mouse-button' cut buffer, only the Motif clipboard. This
is due to the way the JDK is implemented on Unix - there is no way to
changes this.<p>

A crude workaround is to use an application that supports both clipboards,
such as nedit, to transfer data.

<a name=print>
<h1>Why can't I print in JDK 1.2?</h1>
</a>

JDK 1.2 has a bug where the entire printed document is stored in memory,
rather than a spool file. This can fill up memory and cause problems
and crashes.<p>

This bug is entered as #4186108 in the Bug Parade - see
&lt;http://developer.java.sun.com&gt; for details.

<a name=memory>
<h1>Why do I get OutOfMemoryErrors?</h1>
</a>

When you have lots of buffers open, there might not be enough free
space in the <i>Java heap</i>, even though lots of RAM is available.
The solution is to increase the Java heap memory allocation.<p>

On Windows, enter the following in an MS-DOS Prompt before starting jEdit,
or place it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT to have it done every time the
system starts:

<pre>
set JEDIT=-mx<i>nn</i>m
</pre>

On Unix systems with a Bourne shell (ash, bash, jsh, sh, zsh) enter
the following in a command line before starting jEdit, or place it in
your .login or .profile to have it done every time you log in:

<pre>
set JEDIT=-mx<i>nn</i>m; export JEDIT
</pre>

On Unix systems with a C shell (csh, tcsh) enter the following in a
command line before starting jEdit, or place it in your .csh.login
or .csh.profile to have it done every time you log in:

<pre>
setenv JEDIT -mx<i>nn</i>
</pre>

Where <i>nn</i> is the size of the Java heap, in megabytes. The
default is 32 Mb - if you like to open lots of files at once, 64
might be better.<p>

Note that JDK 1.1.8 has a dynamic heap, so this is not necessary.

<a name=noswing>
<h1>Why do I get a ClassDefNotFoundError on startup?</h1>
</a>

If you get a ClassDefNotFoundError: org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.SplashScreen when
jEdit is starting up, the most likely problem is that you do not have
Swing installed properly. For jEdit to work, Swing 1.1beta3 or later
must be installed, and it's swingall.jar file must be in the CLASSPATH.<p>

Swing can be downloaded from &lt;java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html&gt;.

<a name=access>
<h1>Why do I get an AccessException on startup?</h1>
</a>

This is due to a JDK bug on some Unix JDK versions. There are two workarounds:

<ul>
<li>Disable jEdit's RMI interface with the -normi command line option
<li>Edit your <code>/etc/hosts</code> so that your machine's host name
is aliased to something other than 0.0.0.0 (for example, change it to
127.0.0.1, or your machine's actual IP address)
</ul>

<a name=bigfile>
<h1>Why does the display mess up when editing large files?</h1>
</a>

Due to an AWT bug in Unix versions of the JDK, the
Swing JTextComponent component has problems editing documents greater
than about 2000 lines. The problem is that the viewscreen turns gray
and GUI elements are repainted incorrectly.

<a name=overwrite>
<h1>Why doesn't overwrite mode work?</h1>
</a>

Overwrite mode doesn't appear to work on JDK 1.2. I am
working on a fix; it will be available as soon as possible.<p>

If overwrite mode doesn't work on other systems, the most likely
problem is that your jEdit is still loading the AltGrPatch plugin
that was obsoleted as of version 1.6pre4. Delete any copies of
altgr.jar from the system and user plugin directories (see the
<a href=plugins.html>jEdit Plugins</a> help topic for details).

<a name=altgr>
<h1>Why doesn't the AltGr key work?</h1>
</a>

JDK 1.1.7 and earlier had a bug where the AltGr key generated
the wrong keycode. Upgrade to JDK 1.1.8 or later to fix this
problem.

<a name=homeend>
<h1>Why don't C+HOME/C+END work properly?</h1>
</a>

Swing versions earlier than 1.1.1beta2 had broken C+HOME/C+END actions.
Upgrade to a later Swing release.<p>

Swing can be downloaded from &lt;java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html&gt;.

<a name=alt>
<h1>Why don't the Alt key mnemonics work?</h1>
</a>

On JDK 1.2 and 1.1.x where x is earlier than about 6, the AWT incorrectly
sets the modifiers of KEY_TYPED events to 0 even if the Alt key is pressed.
The end result is that the keystroke is inserted in the document. This
is an AWT bug, and as far as I know the only way to fix it is
to upgrade to a later JDK version.

<a name=slow>
<h1>Why is jEdit so slow?</h1>
</a>

Because jEdit is written in Java, it's performance will always be
slower than native applications. A fast system with a good JVM
will narrow the performance gap.<p>

On all systems, a speedup can be achieved by installing the latest
Swing version. Swing 1.1.1 seems to be much faster than either
Swing 1.1beta3 or Swing 1.1final.<p>

Installing more RAM may improve performance - more RAM will
result in less garbage collection.<p>

On Linux, try installing the TYA JIT
