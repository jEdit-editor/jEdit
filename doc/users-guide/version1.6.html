<a name=misc>
<h1>Miscallaneous New Features</h1>
</a>

<ul>
<li>`Open Previous Buffer' and `Open Next Buffer' commands allow
buffer switching from the keyboard
<li>Overwrite mode can now be enabled by pressing `Insert' in the
main text component
<li>A key binding editor now exists in
`Tools-&gt;Global Options-&gt;Shortcuts'
<li>Auto indent can now be optionally be performed when the Enter
key is pressed
<li>The default edit mode for new files can now be set
</ul>

<a name=console>
<h1>Console Enhancements</h1>
</a>

The following changes have been made to the console component:

<ul>
<li>Output is now colorized, depending on it being an informational
message, and error, or parsed error
<li>The exit code of commands is now displayed
<li>Various variables can now be entered as part of the command, for
example $f will expand to the current file name
</ul>

<a name=syntax>
<h1>Syntax Colorizing Enhancements</h1>
</a>

The syntax colorizing system is much smoother in jEdit 1.6 than in 1.5. The
most important changes are:

<ul>
<li>Changing a multiline token will now result in the entire token being
recolorized
<li>An array is now used to store color values, instead of a hashtable,
this results in a noticable speedup
<li>Shell script mode now colorizes multiline literals (&gt;&gt;EOF)
<li>The syntax colorizing system is now easier to embed in other applications
</ul>

<a name=history>
<h1>History Text Field Enhancements</h1>
</a>

The following changes have been made to the history text field component
(used by the console, Search &amp; Replace, and HyperSearch):

<ul>
<li>The history lists are now stored in a seprate $HOME_DIR/.jedit-history
file. Loading this file is much faster than reading hundreds of
seprate properties, one for each entry
<li>The history lists are now shared between multiple components of
the same type. For example, if two Search &amp; Replace dialogs are open,
entering a search string in one will add it to the history list of the
other
<li>The history text field component is now a text field, rather than
a combo box. The change was made because of implementation problems
with the Swing combo box component, and also because the text field is
easier to access from the keyboard
<li>It is now possible to search the history list for a specific string
</ul>

<a name=plugins>
<h1>Plugin System Enhancements</h1>
</a>

Plugins can do much more in jEdit 1.6 than in 1.5. The most important changes
are:

<ul>
<li>Plugins can now add tool bars to views
<li>Plugins can now add submenus to the `Plugins' menu
<li>Plugins can now add tabs to the `Global Options' dialog box
<li>Plugins can specify which version of the JDK and jEdit, and any classes,
they depend on. If the dependencies are not satisfied, an error message is
printed
<li>Plugins can now use classes loaded from other plugins
<li>Plugins can now include documentation which will be listed in the help
system
<li>Resource loading from plugin JARs using standard Java methods now works
</ul>

<a name=bugs>
<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>
</a>

<ul>
<li>HyperSearch would have problems if the view's buffer was changed
<li>Fixed incorrect behaviour of `Replace' button in Search &amp; Replace
dialog
<li>Paste previous would stop working after the maximum number of clippings
was present
<li>Closing an unsaved file could display the `save file' dialog twice
<li>Closing a file would set the buffer of all views to the last one
<li>Mode.enter() was being called twice by Buffer.setMode()
<li>Minor fix to MacOS instructions in README.txt
<li>Full set of C++ keywords is now colorized
<li>Fixed NullPointerException when loading desktop entries with
unknown edit modes (this could occur, for example when starting
1.6pre1 for the first time after running 1.5)
<li>Fixed minor problem with line and bracket highlighting when
options dialog is closed
<li>The -usrprops= command line parameter didn't work
<li>Fixed minor bug when saving recent file list
<li>`Replace In Selection' did strange things to the selection start value
<li>Paths of the form C:blah\blah (with no slash after the drive letter)
were not handled correctly by jEdit
<li>Reload could throw an exception if the reloaded file was shorter
than the current one and the caret was at the end of the document
<li>Console can now be moved in Swing 1.1.1
<li>Loaded JARs don't have to contain a Plugin instance for resource
loading to work
<li>JARClassLoader no longer attempts to instantiate abstract classes and
interfaces whose names end with `Plugin'
<li>JavaScript wasn't colorized correctly in HTML mode if an incomplete
string literal was found
