CHANGES BETWEEN JEDIT 1.1 AND 1.2 (version1.1.txt, last modified 12 Dec 1998)

Contents
--------
1. JDK 1.2 Support
2. Syntax Colorizing
3. New Text Editing Commands
4. Buffer Local Properties
5. Other Improvements

1. JDK 1.2 Support
------------------
jEdit now requires JDK 1.1 with Swing 1.1beta3 or JDK 1.2 to run. Swing 
1.1 is faster than Swing 1.0.x when editing text files because it uses 
an Emacs-style `gap' buffer to store the text.

2. Syntax Colorizing
--------------------
jEdit now does `syntax colorizing'. Syntax colorizing is the ability to 
show specific parts of text in a diffirent color. This makes complex 
source files easier to read. jEdit colorizes the following file types:
- MS-DOS Batch files
- C/C++ source
- HTML source
- Java source
- Makefiles
- Shell scripts
- TeX files

3. New Text Editing Commands
----------------------------
Several commands have been added to the `Edit' menu. They are:
- `Edit->Format': formats selected text or whole buffer by wrapping long 
  lines and removing duplicate spaces.
- `Edit->Expand Abbreviation': scans backwards for possible completions 
  of current word
- `Edit->Locate Bracket': finds bracket that matches the one after the 
  caret
- `Edit->Locate Block': selects the current code block, enclosed in 
  brackets
- `Edit->Locate Paragraph': selects the current paragraph

4. Buffer Local Properties
--------------------------
Some properties such as tab size, edit mode and various mode-specific 
values can now be set on a per-file basis.

5. Other Improvements
---------------------
There are many smaller improvements in jEdit 1.2. Some of them are 
listed below.

- The functionality of jOpen has been integrated into the main jEdit 
  program. jEdit automatically connects to the server if it is running. 
  This can be turned off with the `-noserver' switch.
- The `Mode' menu has been moved into the main menubar and out of the 
  `Edit' menu, and the `Go To Line', `Set Marker', `Clear Marker' and
  `Go To Marker' commands have been moved from the `Edit' menu to the 
  `Search' menu.
- Views now switch to the previous, rather than the first buffer when the
  current buffer is closed.
- jEdit should start up faster when lots of files have been specified on 
  the command line.
- The `Open in Netscape' command now prompts if the file should be saved 
  first if there are unsaved changes.
- Several minor bugs in the JAR loader were fixed.
- Several commands that were distributed as plugins have been moved into 
  the main program.
- The `jedit.props' file is now stored in the jedit.jar JAR file.
- The documentation in jEdit 1.2 has improved quite a bit since 1.1.
