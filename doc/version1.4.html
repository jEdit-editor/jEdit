<h1>New Commands</h1>
</a>

The following new commands have been added to jEdit 1.4:
<ul>
<li>Commands for quick compile-edit-fix cycles (they parse compiler errors,
allowing you to jump to the file and line number where the error occured)
<li>Paste Predefined (for inserting predefined strings)
<li>Wing/Box/Block Comment (comments the selection in various ways, using
mode-specific comment characters)
<li>Uncomment (removes comment characters from the selection)
<li>Exchange Anchor and Caret (does what it says)
<li>Go to End of Indent (moves the caret to the first non-whitespace character
of the current line)
<li>Scroll to Line (scrolls the text area so that the current line is
in the middle)
<li>Select Line Range (selects a range of lines)
<li>Accent Converter (converts french accents to HTML entities) - This command
is distributed as a .jar file seprately from the main jedit.jar.

<a name=search>
<h1>Search And Replace Improvements</h1>
</a>

There is now a `Replace in Selection' command that replaces all instances
the the search string with the replacement string, in the selected text
only.

<a name=indent>
<h1>Auto Indent Improvements</h1>
</a>

jEdit's auto indent mode can now shift the indent according to the
number of braces ({,}) in the previous and current lines. This functionality
is used in C, C++, Java and JavaScript modes.

<a name=status>
<h1>User Interface Improvements</h1>
</a>

jEdit 1.3's space wasting and cryptic status bar is no more. The file modified
and read only status is now displayed in the title bar (`(modified)' or
`(read only)' is appended to the file name). The line number display has been
moved to the top right corner of the menu bar. The column number is also
displayed.<p>

In previous versions of jEdit, autoscrolling only started when the caret
was on the last or first visible line, respectively. In jEdit 1.4, at
least 4 lines are always visible above and below the caret.<p>

The keyboard shortcut, if any is now drawn right justified within menu items.
This results in a much cleaner appearance, and the shortcuts are now easier
to see and locate.<p>

When a new view is created, a random hint is displayed in the title bar.
When you start typing, it will disappear.

<h1>Documentation Improvements</h1>
</a>

As with every previous jEdit version, 1.4 has slightly better documentation.
Separate help topics are available for plain text and program source editing,
each outlining the commands most useful for each.
