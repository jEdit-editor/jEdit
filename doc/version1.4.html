<h1>New Commands</h1>
</a>

The following new commands have been added to jEdit 1.4:
<ul>
<li>Commands for quick compile-edit-fix cycles (they parse compiler errors,
allowing you to jump to the file and line number where the error occurred)
<li>Paste Predefined (for inserting predefined strings)
<li>Wing/Box/Block Comment (comments the selection in various ways, using
mode-specific comment characters)
<li>Uncomment (removes comment characters from the selection)
<li>Exchange Anchor and Caret (does what it says)
<li>Go to End of Indent (moves the caret to the first non-whitespace character
of the current line)
<li>Scroll to Line (scrolls the text area so that the current line is
in the middle)
<li>Select Line Range (selects a range of lines)
<li>Reload (reloads the current file from disk)
<li>Commands for converting French accents to HTML entities and vice versa
- Because it's not very general, this command is distributed as a .jar file
separately from the main jedit.jar. Contributed by
Romain Guy &lt;RomainGuy@aol.com&gt;.
</ul>

<a name=sticky>
<h1>Sticky File Format</h1>
</a>

jEdit now saves files with their original line separators - previous versions
always used the line separator set in Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General.

<a name=syntax>
<h1>Syntax Colorizing Improvements</h1>
</a>

The syntax colorizing subsystem has undergone the following changes:

<ul>
<li>Patch (DIFF) mode added (For editing Unix patches and diffs)
<li>Properties/INI mode added (For editing Java properties and MS-DOS INI files)
<li>Transact-SQL mode added (For editing Transact-SQL source)
<li>C/C++/Java mode is faster
<li>Many syntax colorizing bugs were fixed
</ul>

<a name=search>
<h1>Search And Replace Improvements</h1>
</a>

There is now a `Replace in Selection' command that replaces all instances
the the search string with the replacement string, in the selected text
only.<p>

The up arrow/down arrow keys can be used to recall previous search strings
in the Search &amp; Replace and HyperSearch dialogs.<p>

A `keep dialog' option has been added to the Search &amp; Replace dialog.
When it is selected, the dialog box will not be closed after a search
operation.

<a name=indent>
<h1>Auto Indent Improvements</h1>
</a>

jEdit's auto indent mode can now shift the indent according to the
number of braces ({,}) in the previous and current lines. This functionality
is used in C, C++, Java and JavaScript modes.

<a name=status>
<h1>User Interface Improvements</h1>
</a>

The main editor window and most non-modal dialogs now appear in their previous
location, instead of defaulting to the center of the screen every time.<p>

jEdit 1.3's space wasting and cryptic status bar is no more. The file modified
and read only status is now displayed in the title bar (`(modified)' or
`(read only)' is appended to the file name). The line number display has been
moved to the top right corner of the menu bar. The column number is also
displayed.<p>

In previous versions of jEdit, autoscrolling only started when the caret
was on the last or first visible line, respectively. In jEdit 1.4, at
least 3 lines are always visible above and below the caret.<p>

The keyboard shortcut, if any is now drawn right justified within menu items.
This results in a much cleaner appearance, and the shortcuts are now easier
to see and locate.<p>

The caret is hidden when a selection is active. This makes jEdit more
consistent with the behaviour of most MacOS text editors.<p>

An Emacs/VIM-style block caret can be enabled in Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Editor.
<p>

A right click context menu is now available for quick mouse-based editing.<p>

When a new view is created, a random usage hint is displayed in the title bar.
When you start typing, it will disappear. This is intended to help you get the
most out of jEdit's features.

<a name=help>
<h1>Documentation Improvements</h1>
</a>

As with every previous jEdit version, 1.4 has slightly better documentation.
Separate help topics are available for plain text and program source editing,
each outlining the commands most useful for each.

<a name=bugs>
<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>
</a>

<p> <!-- Swing HTML component bugs -->
jEdit 1.4 fixes the following bugs present in 1.3:

<ul>
