<a name=indent>
<h1>Auto Indent Improvements</h1>
</a>

jEdit's auto indent mode can now shift the indent according to the
number of braces ({,}) in the previous and current lines. This functionality
is used in C, C++, Java and JavaScript modes.

<a name=status>
<h1>Status Bar Improvements</h1>
</a>

jEdit 1.3's space wasting and cryptic status bar is no more. The file modified
and read only status is now displayed in the title bar (`(modified)' or
`(read only)' is appended to the file name). The line number display has been
moved to the top right corner of the menu bar. The column number is also
displayed.

<a name=borders>
<h1>Electric Borders</h1>
</a>

In previous versions of jEdit, autoscrolling only started when the caret
was on the last or first visible line, respectively. In jEdit 1.4, at
least 4 lines are always visible above and below the caret.

<a name=ide>
<h1>Quick Compile-Edit-Fix Cycles</h1>
</a>

jEdit now parses the output of compilers and attempts to build a list
of errors that can be jumped to be quickly fixed.

<a name=commands>
<h1>New Commands</h1>
</a>

The following new commands have been added to jEdit 1.4:
<ul>
<li>Exchange Anchor and Caret (does what it says)
<li>Go to End of Indent (moves the caret to the first non-whitespace character
of the current line)
<li>Scroll to Line (scrolls the text area so that the current line is
in the middle)
<li>Wing/Box/Block Comment (comments the selection in various ways, using
mode-specific comment characters)
<li>Uncomment (removes comment characters from the selection)
</ul>

<a name=menuitem>
<h1>Menu Item Improvements</h1>
</a>

The keyboard shortcut, if any is now drawn right justified within menu items.
This results in a much cleaner appearance, and the shortcuts are now easier
to see and locate.

<a name=hints>
<h1>Usage Hints in the Title Bar</h1>
</a>

When a new view is created, a random hint is displayed in the title bar.
When you start typing, it will disappear.

<a name=help>
<h1>Documentation Improvements</h1>
</a>

As with every previous jEdit version, 1.4 has slightly better documentation.
Separate help topics are available for plain text and program source editing,
each outlining the commands most useful for each.

<a name=bugs>
<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>
</a>

jEdit 1.4 fixes the following bugs present in 1.3:
