<a name=intro>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

This file describes jEdit's most basic functions. It assumes you are
familiar with another text editor, for example GEdit on Unix, Notepad on
Windows or SimpleText on the MacOS.<p>

<a name=starting>
<h1>Starting jEdit</h1>
</a>

jEdit can be started from the command line to edit one or more
files like this:

<blockquote><code>jedit &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;...</code></blockquote>

If the file name contains a hash (#) the remainder of the file name
after the hash character is the name of a marker that will be jumped to.
(See the <a href=advanced.html#markers>Markers</a> help topic for more
information.<p>

A number of `switches' can also be passed to jEdit.

<blockquote><code>
	-version: Display jEdit version and exit<br>
	-usage: Display a command line usage message and exit<br>
	-nousrprops: Don't load user properties<br>
	-noserver: Don't start server<br>
	-nodesktop: Ignore saved desktop<br>
	-nosplash: Don't show initial splash screen<br>
	-usrprops=&lt;file&gt;: Load user properties from &lt;file&gt;<br>
	-portfile=&lt;file&gt;: Save server port to &lt;file&gt;<br>
	-desktopfile=&lt;file&gt;: Save desktop to &lt;file&gt;<br>
	-readonly: Open files read only<br>
	--: End of options<br>
</code></blockquote>

Because the `-' character is reserved for switches, you must enter the
`--' parameter prior to any file names that start with `-'.

<blockquote><code>jedit -- -filename</code></blockquote>

jEdit can also be started from a GUI or command line with no parameters,
in which case it will either open any files that were open in the last
session, or if the `save desktop' feature is disabled, a blank
`Untitled' file.<p>

<a name=opening>
<h1>Opening Files</h1>
</a>

<p>
Once jEdit is started, files can be opened in a number of ways:

<ul>
<li><b>By starting another copy of jEdit.</b> -
if jEdit is started when there is another copy running, the files are opened in
the already running copy.
<li><b>With the `File->Open File' command.</b> - This displays a standard
(or not so standard, depending on the look and feel selected in
`Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General') file selection dialog box.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Open URL' command.</b> - This displays a text
entry dialog where a URL can be entered. The name `Open URL' is somewhat
misleading, since file names, as well as URLs, can be entered. The
exact protocols available depend on the Java implementation - most support
ftp: and http:.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Open Selection' command.</b> - This opens the file
or URL specified by the currently selected text.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Open Recent' menu. </b>- This menu displays
the most recently opened files, 8 by default but this can be changed in
`Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;New File' command.</b> - This command creates an
empty file named `Untitled-n' where <i>n</i> is the number of `Untitled'
files open so far. The new file isn't actually created on disk until you save;
see below.
</ul>

<a name=saving>
<h1>Saving Files</h1>
</a>

Any changes made to open files aren't actually stored to disk until you
save. (But see below about the auto save feature). To save the file to
disk, do one of the following:

<ul>
<li><b>Close the file or exit jEdit.</b> - If you close a file or exit jEdit,
you will be asked if any unsaved changes should be saved.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Save' command.</b> - This command saves the file
to disk without further user input. If the file is `Untitled', you will
be prompted to enter a file name first.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Save As' command.</b> - This command displays a
file selection dialog box where an alternative path name to save the file to
can be entered or selected.
<li><b>With the `File-&gt;Save to URL' command.</b> - This command displays
a text entry dialog box where a URL to save the file to can be entered.
As with `Open URL', file path names are accepted too. The available protocols
and the exact behaviour of URL uploading depend on the Java implementation.
</ul>

<h2>Autosave</h2>

If jEdit crashes, there is still a good chance that you will be able
to recover any unsaved changes.<p>

Every 15 seconds (the interval can be changed in
`Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General') a copy of every open file with unsaved
changes is written out to #filename# where <i>filename</i> is the name
of the file. If jEdit crashes (or you do a file listing in a directory
which contains files open in jEdit) you will see these autosave files.<p>

If jEdit has truly crashed, you can try opening these autosave files
to see if they contain what you were editing before jEdit crashed. If
so, you can overwrite the original copy of the file.<p>

You might also see files named #filename#+tmp+# where <i>filename</i>
is a file you were editing. A file named that means that jEdit crashed
while writing out a new autosave - the old one should still be in
#filename#. The +tmp+ version is probably useless, since it is
incomplete.<p>

<h2>Backups</h2>

Sometimes you start editing a file, save it several times, then decide
that you don't like the changes.<p>

The first time you save a file after opening it, jEdit copies the old
vesion to filename~ where <i>filename</i> is the name of the file being
saved. Subsequent saves don't update the backup - you must close
the file and save it again for that to happen. The result is that the
backup always contains the file, as it was before you started editing it.<p>

Multiple backups (named filename~1~, filename~2~ ... filename~10~ and so on,
1 being the newest and 10 being the oldest) can enabled in
`Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General'.<p>

<a name=sendPrint>
<h1>Sending and Printing Files</h1>
</a>

Files can be sent via e-mail with the `File-&gt;Send' command.
`File-&gt;Print' can be used to print the file to a printer (or on some
operating systems, to a PostScript file).

<a name=clipboard>
<h1>Cut, Copy and Paste</h1>
</a>

jEdit has several commands for moving and copying text. They are:

<ul>
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Cut</b> - this command places the selection in the
clipboard and removes it from the document.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Copy</b> - this command places the selection in the
clipboard and leaves it in the document.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Paste</b> - places the clipboard contents in the
document, replacing the selection, if any.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Paste Previous</b> - displays a list of previously
copied and pasted strings available for insertion. By default, the last
100 clippings are remembered - this can be changed in
`Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General'.
</ul>

<a name=undo>
<h1>Undo and Redo</h1>
</a>

In case you make a mistake, the `Edit-&gt;Undo' command undoes the last
editing action. Up to 100 previous actions can be undone. If you undo
too much, try `Edit-&gt;Redo'.

<a name=shortcuts>
<h1>Keyboard Shortcuts</h1>
</a>

Within jEdit, keyboard shortcuts are written as
<code>modifier+key</code>, where <code>modifier</code> is S for Shift,
C for Control, or A for Alt. <code>key</code> is either a letter,
or a named key such as PageUp.<p>

Some keyboard shortcuts consist of more than one keystroke, for
example `Delete Paragraph' is <code>C+d C+e</code>. Both key
strokes must be pressed in the respective order.

<h2>Menu Item Shortcuts</h2>
The most frequently used menu item commands have keyboard shortcuts.
They are listed to the right of the menu item's label.

<h2>Menu Mnemonics</h2>

Pressing the Alt key in combination with one of the underlined
characters in the menu bar activates the respective menu. Once a
menu is open, an item in it can be selected by pressing the
underlined character in its label.<p>

While a menu is open, the arrow keys can be used to select menu
items, and Space or Enter will activate the selected menu item.<p>

The F10 key can be used to activate the menu bar for menu
selection via arrow keys.

<h2>Dialog Shortcuts</h2>

All dialogs have an OK button which can be activated by pressing
the Enter key.<p>

Most dialogs also have a Cancel button which can be activated by
pressing the Escape key.<p>

Tab and Shift+Tab can be used to shift the keyboard focus to the
next and previous component in a dialog box.

<h2>Text Editing Shortcuts</h2>

The following shortcuts are available in most text components,
including the main editor component and the text fields in various
dialogs.<p>

If Shift is held down in combination with any
of these keys, the selection is extended, rather than the caret
being moved.

<table border=3>

<tr>
<td>Backspace</td> <td>Deletes the character before the caret.
If there is a selection, it will be deleted instead.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Delete</td> <td>Deletes the character after the caret.
If there is a selection, it will be deleted instead.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Left, Right, Up, Down</td> <td>Moves the caret in the
respective direction.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>C+Left, C+Right</td> <td>Moves the caret one word
backward and one word forward, respectively.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Home</td> <td>Moves the caret to the start of the line.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>End</td> <td>Moves the caret to the end of the line.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>C+Home</td> <td>Moves the caret to the start of the text.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>C+End</td> <td>Moves the caret to the end of the text.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PageUp</td> <td>Moves the caret up one screenful of text.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PageDown</td> <td>Moves the caret down one screenful of text.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<a name=views>
<h1>Using Multiple Editor Windows</h1>
</a>

By default, jEdit has only one editor window, or <i>view</i>, open. All
open files, or <i>buffers</i> are opened in that view. However, new views
can be created with the `File-&gt;New View' command, and they can be
closed with `File-&gt;Close View'. The `Buffers' menu can be used to select
which buffer the current view is to edit. Several views can be editing the
same buffer, in which case changes in one view will propagate to all others
editing the same buffer.

<a name=server>
<h1>The jEdit Server</h1>
</a>

When jEdit is first started, it creates a new server thread that listens
on a free TCP/IP socket. Subsequent invocations of jEdit connect to that
socket and inform it of any files that are to be opened. This technique
cuts down on memory usage because there is only one instance of jEdit open
at any one time.<p>

The server can be disabled either on a `one-time' basis with the
`-noserver' switch, or permanently in `Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General'.

<a name=desktop>
<h1>The Desktop File</h1>
</a>

When jEdit exits it saves the list of open files to the `desktop' file,
so that the next time jEdit is started with no command line parameters,
it can reopen those files.<p>

The desktop can be disabled either on a `one-time' basis with the
`-nodesktop' switch, or permanently in `Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General'.<p>
