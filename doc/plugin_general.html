<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

jEdit has a plugin architecture that can be used to add features to the
editor. Plugins are distributed as JAR files. When jEdit starts up, it
loads the contents of the JAR files.

<a name=jar>
<h1>Contents of JAR Files</h1>
</a>

Any files whose names end with .props found in the JAR file are loaded into
the jEdit property table, and their contents can be accessed with the
<code>jEdit.getProperty()</code> method. See the
<a href=api/org.gjt.sp.jedit.jEdit.html>org.gjt.sp.jedit.jEdit</a>
class for details.<p>

Class files whose names end with `Plugin' (eg, Rot13Plugin) are loaded,
instantiated and added to the plugin list. Other class files are loaded
only when they're referenced by another class.

<a name=plugin>
<h1>Plugin Interface</h1>
</a>

The only type of class file loaded immediately is that which implements
the <a href=api/org.gjt.sp.jedit.Plugin.html>org.gjt.sp.jedit.Plugin</a>
interface - therefore you must provide an implementation of that class
to get the ball rolling.<p>

Due to the way the class loader works, the names of Plugin implementations
must end with `Plugin'.<p>

The <code>getName()</code> method isn't currently used, by a meaningful
value should be returned for future compatibility.<p>

In the <code>start()</code> method, one would usually register any actions
and modes with jEdit via the <code>jEdit.addPluginAction()</code> and
<code>jEdit.addMode()</code> methods. See the
<a href=api/org.gjt.sp.jedit.jEdit.html>org.gjt.sp.jedit.jEdit</a>
class for details.<p>

The <code>stop()</code> method should do what is appropriate on exiting,
for example deleting any temporary files created by the plugin.
