VERSION INFORMATION (VERSION.txt, last modified 21 Nov 1998)

-- To Do For 1.2:
- port to Swing 1.1 (change FileDialog to JFileChooser, use GapContent, etc)
- Syntax colorizing (when printing, too)
- Word wrap (when printing, too)
- Flash brace being closed
- GUI extension map editor (maybe not)
- Fix Java mode bug: tabSize property ignored
- Fix Java mode bug: caret goes to end of line after indent (tricky to fix)
- Fix Java mode bug: multi-line Javadoc comments go all over the place

-- Version 1.2pre2:
- Useful expand abbreviation feature (similar to Emacs' Meta-/)
- Netscape plugin integrated into main program
- Auto indent and Java modes integrated into main program
- gnu.regexp included again (nobody can be bothered downloading it :) )
- Java mode updates
- Command/prop manager API split (normal versions show error dialogs,
  _ prefixed versions throw exceptions or return null pointers)
- Documentation updates
- Minor config.bat updates
- Minor PropsMgr updates

-- Version 1.2pre1:
- Search and replace should actually work now
- Fixed silly (but obscure) CommandMgr bug (classes that directly depend on
  classes after them in the JAR file wouldn't load)
- gnu.regexp no longer bundled with jEdit, download it yourself
- Fixed some null pointer conditions in jEdit.loadMenu{Bar,Item} and CommandMgr
- Put everything in org.gjt.sp.jedit package
- Auto indent mode updates: markers and caret are now preserved on lines being
  indented
- Netscape plugin asks if file should be saved first if there are unsaved
  changes
- Auto Indent Options command removed, use `ai' buffer-local property instead
- Java mode
- `jedit.home' property not needed anymore
- When a buffer is closed, the view switches to the previous, not the
  first buffer
- jEdit now tries to connect to the server when starting. This makes jOpen
  redundant
- Changed superclass of SyntaxTextArea to JEditorPane
- Properties can be embedded in files (currently, tabSize and mode)
- Minor configure script updates
- Documentation updates
