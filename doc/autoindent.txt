AUTO INDENT MODE (autoindent.txt, last modified 21 Nov 1998)

The auto indent mode overrides the default Tab key behaviour to copy all
white space from the start of the previous line to the start of the current
one. If both lines line up, a normal Tab will be inserted.

The auto indent mode's internal name is `autoindent', and it is the name that
can be used as the value of the `mode' buffer-local property.

The auto indent mode uses the following buffer-local properties:
- `tabSize': The tab size
- `ai': A list of characters that are treated as white space (in addition to
  tab, new line and space)
