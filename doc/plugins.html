<h1>jEdit Plugins</h1>
</a>

jEdit has a powerful plugin architecture. Plugins can be used to add
almost any feature to jEdit. They are easy to write and even easier to
install.

<h1>Installing Plugins</h1>
</a>

Plugins are distributed as JAR files. They have a .jar extension.<p>

Plugins can be installed in one of two directories - the system plugin
directory and the user plugin directory. Plugins in the system directory
can be used by all users on the system. Plugins in a user's plugin
directory can only be used by the respective user.<p>

On Unix, the system plugin directory is
/opt/slava/share/jedit-<code>&lt;version&gt;</code>/jars, Each user has a
plugin directory in $HOME/.jedit-jars.<p>

On Windows 95 and 98, the system plugin directory is C:\Program
Files\jEdit\jars. The user plugin directory is %JAVAHOME%\.jedit-jars.<p>

On Windows NT, the system plugin directory is the same as that on
Windows 95/98, but each user has a plugin directory in
%HOME%\.jedit-jars.<p>

<h1>Using Plugins</h1>
</a><p>

Once a plugin is installed, jEdit will say so during startup.

<blockquote><pre>
	Loading plugin /opt/slava/share/jedit-1.3final/jars/rot13.jar
</pre></blockquote>

If all goes well during startup, the plugins should also appear in the
`Plugins' menu. If a newly installed plugin doesn't appear to be loaded,
check that it's in the correct directory and that it's a JAR file.<p>

If a plugin doesn't appear in the plugins menu but a `Loading...'
message is printed, the plugin might be incompatible with your version
of jEdit.<p>

<h1>Developing Plugins</h1>
</a>

Plugins are stored in JAR files. The JAR file can contain two types of
entries - properties and classes. Other types of entries are ignored.<p>

Property entries have a .props extension. The property file format is
described in the API documentation for the <code>java.util.Properties</code>
class.<p>

Class entries have a .class extension and are standard Java class files.<p>

<h2>Edit Modes</h2>

jEdit edit modes implement the <code><a href=api/org.gjt.sp.jedit.Mode.html>
org.gjt.sp.jedit.Mode</a></code> interface. Also, the following properties
apply to edit modes:

<table border=3>
<tr>
<td>mode.&lt;modename&gt;.name</td> <td>The name that appears in the `Mode'
menu and several other places</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mode&lt;modename&gt;.&lt;property&gt;</td> <td>The default value of
the buffer-local property named <code>property</code> for the specified
edit mode</td>
<tr>
<td>mode.extension.&lt;ext&gt;</td> <td>The mode to use for files with
extension <code>ext</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mode.filename.&lt;filename&gt;</td> <td>The mode to use for files named
<code>filename</code></td>.
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mode.firstline,&lt;firstline&gt;</td> <td>The mode to use for files whose
first line is <code>firstline</code>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Commands</h2>

jEdit commands extend the <code><a href=api/org.gjt.sp.jedit.EditAction.html>
org.gjt.sp.jedit.EditAction</a></code> class.<p>
The command's menu label is stored in the <code>&lt;command&gt;.label</code>
property where <code>command</code> is the command name. The shortcut can
also be specified with the <code>&lt;command&gt;.shortcut</code> property,
but doing so isn't recommended since future versions of jEdit might use
that shortcut.
