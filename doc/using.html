<h1>Starting jEdit</h1>
</a>

jEdit can be started from the command line to edit one or more
files like this:

<blockquote><code>jedit &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt;...</code></blockquote>

If the file name contains a hash (#) the remainder of the file name
after the hash character is the name of a marker that will be jumped to
in the opened file.<p>

A number of `switches' can also be passed to jEdit.

<blockquote><code>
	-version: Display jEdit version and exit<br>
	-usage: Display a command line usage message and exit<br>
	-nousrprops: Don't load user properties<br>
	-noserver: Don't start server<br>
	-nodesktop: Ignore saved desktop<br>
	-nosplash: Don't show initial splash screen<br>
	-usrprops=&lt;file&gt;: Load user properties from &lt;file&gt;<br>
	-portfile=&lt;file&gt;: Save server port to &lt;file&gt;<br>
	-desktopfile=&lt;file&gt;: Save desktop to &lt;file&gt;<br>
	-readonly: Open files read only<br>
	--: End of options<br>
</code></blockquote>

Because the `-' character is reserved for switches, you must enter the
`--' parameter prior to any files whose names start with `-'.

<blockquote><code>jedit -- -filename</code></blockquote>

jEdit can also be started from a GUI or command line with no parameters,
in which case it will either open any files that were open in the last
session, or if the `save desktop' feature is disabled, a blank
`Untitled' file.<p>

<a name=server>
<h1>The jEdit Server</h1>
</a>

When jEdit is first started, it creates a new server thread that listens
on a free TCP/IP socket. Subsequent invocations of jEdit connect to that
socket and inform it of any files that are to be opened, and the thread
opens those files. This technique cuts down on memory usage because
there is only one instance of jEdit open at any one time.<p>

The server can be disabled either on a `one-time' basis with the
`-noserver' switch, or permanently in the
<a href=menu_tools.html#options>Options</a> dialog box.<p>

<a name=desktop>
<h1>The Desktop File</h1>
</a>

When jEdit exits it saves the list of open files to the `desktop' file,
so that the next time jEdit is started, it can reopen those files.<p>

The desktop can be disabled either on a `one-time' basis with the
`-nodesktop' switch, or permanently in the
<a href=menu_tools.html#options>Options</a> dialog box.<p>

<a name=buffers>
<h1>Buffers</h1>
</a>

A buffer is an in-memory copy of an open file. All editing operations
are performed on the buffer - the original remains unchanged on disk
until the buffer is `saved'. The number of open buffers is only limited
by available memory.<p>

<a name=buffer-props>
<h2>Buffer-Local Properties</h2>
</a>

Several paremeters such as the tab size can be set on a per-buffer
basis with <i>buffer-local properties</i>.When a
file is loaded, jEdit looks for something like the following in the first
10 lines:

<blockquote><code>
	(:name=value:...)
</code></blockquote>

Any number of name/value pairs can be specified.<p>

The following properties are supported:

<table border=3>


<tr>
<td>closeBrackets</td> <td>A list of closing brackets, used by the
<a href=menu_edit.html#locate-bracket>Locate Bracket</a> and
<a href=menu_edit.html#select-block>Select Code Block</a> commands.
Default is `)]}'.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>compiler</td> <td>The compiler to use for the buffer. Default is mode
specific.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>mode</td> <td>The edit mode to use for the buffer. Default is none.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>make</td> <td>The name of the `make' tool. The global default can
also be specified in the <a href=menu_tools.html#options>Options</a> dialog
box.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>maxLineLen</td> <td>The maximum line length, used by the
<a href=menu_edit.html#format>Format</a> command. Default is 72.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>noTabs</td> <td>In edit modes with automatic indentation (all the edit
modes included with jEdit except for Text) if set to `yes', Tab characters
will not b eused, and an equivalent number of spaces will
be inserted instead. The <a href=menu_edit.html>Shift Indent Left</a> and
<a href=menu_edit.html>Shift Indent Right</a> commands use this property
as well.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>noWordSep</td> <td>A list of non-alphanumeric characters that are
not to be treated like word separators by the
<a href=menu_edit.html#expand-abbrev>Expand Abbreviation</a> command.
Default is none, however the C, C++ and
Java edit modes define this to `._' by default.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>openBrackets</td> <td>A list of open brackets, used by the
<a href=menu_edit.html#locate-bracket>Locate Bracket</a> and
<a href=menu_edit.html#select-block>Select Code Block</a> commands. Default
is `([{'.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>tabSize</td> <td>The tab width, in character units. Default is 8.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<a name=views>
<h1>Views</h2>
</a>

A view is an editor window, the user interface for editing buffers.
Each view can edit one buffer at a time, and any number of views can be
editing a buffer. A change in one view is automatically propagated to
all others editing the same buffer.<p>

The user interface of views should be pretty self explanatory - there is
only one part that needs explaining, the status bar. The status bar is
the strip of writing at the bottom. A sample status bar looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
(--:**) editing.html (HTML, Line 32/53 60%)
</pre></blockquote>

The elements, from left to right, are:

<ul>
<li>(--) New file flag. If the current file is not on disk, this is **,
-- otherwise.
<li>(:) Read only flag. If the current file is read only, this is /, :
otherwise.
<li>(**) Changed flag. If the current file has been changed since it was
last saved, this is **, -- otherwise.
<li>(HTML) The current file's edit mode. |XXX edit modes|
<li>(Line 32/53 60%) The current line number and the total number of
lines in the file. The percentage is the ratio of the two.
</ul>

The <a href=menu_file.html#new-view>New View</a> command can be used to
create a new view, and the <a href=menu_file.html#close-view>Close View</a>
command closes the current view. The `Buffers' menu can be used to select
which buffer the current view is editing.

<a name=modes>
<h1>Edit Modes</h1>
</a>

To implement indentation and syntax colorizing, jEdit has <i>edit modes</i> -
each edit mode defining behaviour for editing some type of file. Namely,
edit modes can define the following behaviour:

<ul>
<li><b>Indentation</b> - what to do when the Tab key is pressed
<li><b>Syntax Colorizing</b> - jEdit has the capability to display different
lexical tokens in source code using distinctive colors. Each file type is
colorized accordingly
<li><b>Buffer-Local Properties</b> - defaults for buffer-local properties,
for example the compiler to use
</ul>

When a file is opened, jEdit looks at it's extension, file name and first
line of text to determine which edit mode to use. The following table lists
all edit modes included with jEdit, their internal names (which is the value
that can be used in the `mode' buffer-local property) and how they are
selected.

<table border=3>

<tr>
<th bgcolor=#ccccff>Name</th><th bgcolor=#ccccff>Internal Name</th>
<th bgcolor=#ccccff>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>AMSTeX</td> <td>amstex</td> <td>For editing AMSTeX files. This mode
is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.tex' and
which contain `\documentstyle' in the first 100 lines, but which do not
contain `\begin'. Default compiler is `amstex'.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Auto Indent</td> <td>autoindent</td> <td>Implements semi-intelligent
indentation. All other modes subclass this.</td>
</tr>

mode is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.bat'.</td>
</tr>

<tr>

mode is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.c' or `.h'.
Default compiler is `cc'.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>

</td>
</tr>
