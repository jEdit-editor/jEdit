1. Markers
----------
Most other editors can set `markers' in the text, and go to those markers.
jEdit's markers, however are persistent across editing sessions and can have
names of any length. Markers are set with the `Edit->Set Marker' command,
cleared with `Edit->Clear Marker' and jumped to with `Edit->Go To Marker'.

2. Auto Indent
--------------
This one's useful if you're using jEdit to edit program source code. When
you press return, any white space or comment characters from the start of
the previous line is copied to the start of the new one. Try it out, it's
very useful.

2. Search And Replace
---------------------
Not finished yet.

3. Open Selection
-----------------
The `File->Open Selection' command uses the current selection as the name of
a file to open. This is useful in help files, for example.

4. Editing URLs
---------------
While everyone else is talking about full Internet integration, jEdit is
doing it! The `File->Open URL' and `File->Save To URL' commands enable jEdit
to edit files on the Internet. The protocols supported depend on your Java
Virtual Machine. Sun's one supports http and ftp.
