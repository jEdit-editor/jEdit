1. Markers
----------
Most other editors can set `markers' in the text, and go to those markers.
jEdit's markers, however are saved across editing sessions and can have
names of any length. Markers are set with the `Edit->Set Marker' command,
cleared with `Edit->Clear Marker' and jumped to with `Edit->Go To Marker'.

2. Search And Replace
---------------------
Like most editors, jEdit supports regular expression search and replace. See
regexp.txt for details on regexp syntax.

3. Edit Modes
-------------
An editing mode defines a set of characteristics for editing files with a
certain format. jEdit looks at the file's extension to determine which editing
mode to use. The mode can also be changed manually by selecting it from the
`Edit->Mode' menu or with the `mode' buffer-local property (see next section).

Documentation for edit modes included with jEdit can be found in:

autoindent.txt  The auto indent edit mode
java.txt        The Java edit mode

4. Buffer-Local Properties
--------------------------
Some setting such as tab size and edit mode can be set on a per-file basis by
inserting the following text in the first 10 lines of the file:

	(:<name>=<value>:<another name>=<another value>:<and so on>:)

The following properties are used by jEdit:
- `tabSize': The tab size
- `ws': word separator characters, used by `Expand Abbreviation' command
- `mode': The edit mode
In addition, most edit modes define some of their own.

5. Expand Abbreviation Command
------------------------------
This command is very useful - it finds the previous occurance of the current
word and completes it at the caret. For example, if you type `jE' and push
C-/, you will get `jEdit', assuming that it appears previously in the file.
(Similar to the Meta-/ command in emacs).

6. Customising jEdit
--------------------
Simple settings such as the font, print margins, word wrap and many
miscallanous options can be changed in the `Edit->Options' dialog. See
menus.txt and props.txt for information about customising menus and strings.
