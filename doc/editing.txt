1. Markers
----------
Most other editors can set `markers' in the text, and go to those 
markers. jEdit's markers, however are saved across editing sessions and 
can have names of any length. Markers are set with the `Search->Set 
Marker' command, cleared with `Search->Clear Marker' and jumped to with 
`Search->Go To Marker'.

2. Search And Replace
---------------------
Like most editors, jEdit supports regular expression search and 
replace. See regexp.txt for details on regexp syntax.

3. Buffer-Local Properties
--------------------------
Some setting such as tab size and edit mode can be set on a per-file 
basis by inserting the following text in the first 10 lines of the 
file:

	(:<property>=<value>:<another property>=<another value>:)

The following properties are used by jEdit:
- `tabSize': The tab size
- `maxLineLen': maximum line length, used by the `Format' command
- `wordSep': word separator characters, used by `Expand Abbreviation' 
  command
- `openBracket': open brackets, used by the `Locate Bracket' and
  `Locate Block' commands
- `closeBracket': close brackets, used by the `Locate Bracket' and 
  `Locate Block' commands
- `mode': The edit mode
In addition, most edit modes define some of their own.

4. Miscallaneous Commands
-------------------------
There are several useful commands in the `Edit' menu. They are:
- `Edit->Format': formats selected text or whole buffer by wrapping long 
lines and removing duplicate spaces.
- `Edit->Expand Abbreviation': scans backwards for possible completions 
  of the current word.
- `Edit->Locate Bracket': finds the bracket that matches the one before 
  the caret.
- `Edit->Locate Block': selects the current code block, enclosed in brackets.
- `Edit->Locate Paragraph': selects the current paragraph.

5. Edit Modes
-------------
An edit mode defines the required behaviour to edit a certain type of 
file. Currently, edit modes can define indentation behaviour and syntax 
colorizing rules. Syntax colorizing is the ability to show specific 
parts of text in a diffirent color. This makes complex source files 
easier to read.

jEdit looks at the file's extension to determine which editing mode to 
use. The mode can also be changed manually by selecting it from the 
`Mode' menu or with the `mode' buffer-local property.

jEdit comes with the following edit modes:
- Auto Indent: indents lines.
  with buffer local properties and description.
- Batch File: colorizes DOS batch files. (.bat)
- C: colorizes C/C++ source code. (.c, .h, .cc, .cpp)
- HTML: colorizes HTML source. (.html, .shtml, .htm)
- Java: colorizes Java source. (.java)
- Makefile: colorizes UNIX Makefiles. (Makefile, makefile, GNUmakefile)
- Shell Script: colorizes UNIX shell scripts. (.sh, also where first line 
  is one of various shell paths)
- TeX: colorizes TeX files. (.tex, .sty, .aux)

More information about the auto indent mode can be found in the following
section.

5.1. Auto Indent Mode
---------------------
The auto indent mode overrides the default Tab key behaviour to copy 
all white space from the start of the previous line to the start of the 
current one. If both lines line up, a normal Tab will be inserted.

The auto indent mode uses the following buffer-local properties:
- `tabSize': The tab size
- `ai': A list of characters that are treated as white space (in addition 
  to tab, new line and space)

All other edit modes inherit this mode's indentation behaviour.

6. Netscape Remote Support
--------------------------
jEdit has two commands useful when editing HTML source: `Open in 
Netscape' which will open the current file in Netscape, and `Open 
Selection in Netscape', which will open the currently selected URL in 
Netscape.

These commands launch Netscape by first trying it with the `-remote' 
switch, which on Unix systems opens URL in a running instance, and then 
without that switch.

On Windows 95/98/NT systems, you must add Netscape's directory to the 
PATH. If the `netscape.exe' executable is in
`C:\Program Files\Netscape\Communicator\Program`, the command to add
that directory to the PATH is:

	set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Netscape\Communicator\Program

It is advisable to place this command in your C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT so that 
it's executed every time the computer starts up.

7. Customising jEdit
--------------------
Simple settings such as the font and print margins can be changed in 
the `Edit->Options' dialog. See menus.txt and props.txt for information 
about customising menus and strings.
