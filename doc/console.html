<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

To make it easier to execute external programs such as compilers, each view
has a built in `console' component that does exactly that. An error parsing
system also exists to make the compile-edit-fix cycle faster.

<h1>General Information</h1>
</a>

The console can be shown and hidden by dragging the patterned bar underneath
the toolbar, or by invoking `Tools-&gt;Show/Hide Console'.<p>

The console consists of a command text field, an output
tab that lists the output of each command, and an errors tab that lists any
parsed errors. Pressing enter in the command field will execute the
currently entered command.<p>

In addition to commands, URLs can also be entered - try entering
`file:C:\autoexec.bat' or similar for jEdit to open that file.

<h1>Error Parsing</h1>
</a>

While a command is running, jEdit attempts to parse any errors it outputs.
Currently, jEdit parses the following error formats:
<ul>
<li>Generic format used by many compilers and utilities:
<blockquote><code>file name:line number:error message</code></blockquote>
<lI>Emacs format used by Jikes Java compiler and several others:
<blockquote><code>
file name:line number:column number:end line number:end column number:<br>
error message</code></blockquote>
<li>TeX-style errors:
<blockquote><code>
! error message<br>
l.line number, error message continued
</code></blockquote>
</ul>

Selecting an error in the errors tab will open the file involved and move the
caret to the line where the error occurred. The `Tools-&gt;Next Error' and
`Tools-&gt;Previous Error' commands can also be used to go to the next and
the previous error, respectively.

<h1>Miscallaneous Commands</h1>
</a>

In addition to the console, jEdit has the following commands for executing
external programs:

<ul>
<li><b>Tools-&gt;Filter Selection</b> - asks for a command to execute, and
inserts the command's output into the document. The command's input is the
selection, if any.
<li><b>Tools-&gt;Compile</b> - used to compile the current file. Invokes
a mode specific compiler - for example, in C mode, this is cc, in Java
this is javac, etc.<p>

The compiler can also be set on a file-by-file basis by setting the
`compiler' buffer-local property, for example by putting this in one of
the first 10 lines of the file:
<blockquote><code>:compiler=c89 -O2 %p:</code></blockquote>
Of course c89 -O2 should be replaced by your compiler and compilation flags,
if any. The %p should appear somewhere in the compiler command - it is
replaced with the file's path name by the compile command.
</ul>
