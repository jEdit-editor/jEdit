{{{ API Changes

- MiscUtilities.getFirstSeparatorIndex now correctly returns the first separator
  index; before the separator after the drive letter on windows was ignored
  and the result on mixed-separator paths were wrong (Björn Kautler)

- MiscUtilities.getLastSeparatorIndex now correctly returns the last separator
  index; before the separator after the drive letter on windows was ignored
  (Björn Kautler)

- MiscUtilities.getLastSeparatorIndex has now an overload that allows to ignore
  trailing path separators when determining the last separator (Björn Kautler)

- By overriding VFS.isRemotePath a VFS can now declare whether a given path
  should be treated as remote path or not (Björn Kautler)

- A new IOUtilities.closeQuietly overload accepting AutoCloseable was added that
  unifies the existing three methods into one, deprecating the old methods
  (Björn Kautler)

- Added MiscUtilities.isUncPath to determine whether a given path is a UNC path
  (Björn Kautler)

- The previous AbstractContextOptionPane constructors are now deprecated; the
  reset button in that class always restored the view context menu for all
  subclasses, in the new constructors the property key has to be specified
  (Björn Kautler)
