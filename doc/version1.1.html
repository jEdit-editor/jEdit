<a name=configure>
<h1>Configure Script</h1>
</a>

In jEdit 1.0, one had to edit the Makefiles to change the install 
directory. A new Configure script takes care of this. It also lets you 
specify your Java virtual machine and javac.

<a name=regexp>
<h1>Improved Search And Replace</h1>
</a>

The search and replace code has changed significantly. It is much 
faster and supports regular expression searching using gnu.regexp.

<a name=server>
<h1>Server Updates</h1>
</a>

The server now checks if an existing port file is valid before bailing 
out. As a result, if jEdit crashes and is restarted, the server will 
start. The server is now more secure as it requires the client to send 
it a secret key stored in the port file. Finally, a shell script 
version of jOpen is installed on Unix systems with netpipes. This 
improves performance. <b>[As of jEdit 1.2, jOpen has been integrated
into the main jEdit program]</b>

<a name=modes>
<h1>Edit Modes</h1>
</a>

Perhaps the most significant change is the addition of edit modes. 
Each edit mode defines a set of rules for editing files with a certain 
format. jEdit 1.1 comes with text and auto indent edit modes.
<b>[As of jEdit 1.4, there are many more edit modes available]</b>

<a name=errors>
<h1>Improved Error Messages</h1>
</a>

Where jEdit 1.0 would dump a stack trace, jEdit 1.1 displays a dialog 
box with an explanation of the error.

<a name=netscape>
<h1>Netscape Remote Support</h1>

jEdit 1.1 has two commands which are useful for Web page editing - 
Open in Netscape and Open Selection in Netscape.
<b>[In jEdit 1.3 the Open in Netscape command has been replaced by a
more generic Open in WWW Browser]</b>

<a name=buffer>
<h1>Improved Buffer Switching</h1>
</a>

In jEdit 1.0, when buffers were switched in a view, the caret would 
jump to the top of the buffer. In 1.1, each buffer's caret position is 
saved and restored when switching.

<a name=speed>
<h1>Performance Enhancements</h1>
</a>

jEdit 1.1 is faster overall than 1.0. The biggest speed increase is 
file loading. Many other functions have been optimised as well.

<a name=bugs>
<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>
</a>

jEdit 1.1 fixes several obscure bugs present in 1.0.
