1. Configure Script
-------------------
In jEdit 1.0, one had to edit the Makefiles to change the install directory.
A new Configure script takes care of this. It also lets you specify your
Java virtual machine and javac.

2. Improved Search And Replace
------------------------------
The search and replace code has changed significantly. It is much faster and
supports regular expression searching using gnu.regexp.

3. Server Updates
-----------------
The server now checks if an existing port file is valid before bailing out. As
a result, if jEdit crashes and is restarted, the server will start. The server
is now more secure as it requires the client to send it a secret key stored in
the port file. Finally, a shell script version of jOpen is installed on Unix
systems with netpipes. This improves performance.

4. Edit Modes
-------------
Perhaps the most significant change is the addition of edit modes. Each edit
mode defines a set of rules for editing files with a certain format. jEdit 1.1
comes with text and auto indent edit modes.

5. Improved Error Messages
--------------------------
Where jEdit 1.0 would dump a stack trace, jEdit 1.1 displays a dialog box
with an explanation of the error.

6. Netscape Remote Support
--------------------------
jEdit 1.1 has two commands which are useful for Web page editing - Open in
Netscape and Open Selection in Netscape.

7. Improved Buffer Switching
----------------------------
In jEdit 1.0, when buffers were switched in a view, the caret would jump to
the top of the buffer. In 1.1, each buffer's caret position is saved and
restored when switching.

8. Performance Enhancements
---------------------------
jEdit 1.1 is faster overall than 1.0. The biggest speed increase is file
loading. Many other functions have been optimised as well.

9. Bug Fixes
------------
jEdit 1.1 fixes several obscure bugs present in 1.0.
