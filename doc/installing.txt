INSTALLING JEDIT (installing.txt, last modified 8 Oct 1998)

1. Unix
-------
Use the supplied Makefile. Log in as root and `make install' in the jEdit
directory. If for some reason you want to recompile the source, do a `make'
before the `make install'.

By default, everything will be installed under /opt/slava. If you want to
install jEdit elsewhere, edit the Make.rules file.

2. Windows 95, 98 and NT
------------------------
Use the makeit.bat batch file to compile it if necessary and the installit.bat
batch file to install it. By default, everything will be installed under
C:\Program Files\jEdit. If you don't like this, edit installit.bat file.

3. MacOS
--------
Could someone with MRJ tell me more about how MRJ handles standalones?
