1. General
----------
jEdit requires a Java VM and Sun's Java Foundation Classes. A Java VM for
Solaris and Windows 95/NT can be found at <http://java.sun.com>. A Linux
version is available at <http://java.blackdown.org>. JFC can be downloaded
from <http://java.sun.com>.

2. Unix & Clones
----------------
Use the supplied Makefile. If you want to recompile the source, type `make' at
a shell prompt in the jEdit directory. Then log in as root and `make install'.

By default, everything will be installed under /opt/slava. If you want to
install jEdit elsewhere, edit the Make.rules file.

3. Windows 95, 98 and NT
------------------------
Use the makeit.bat batch file to compile it if necessary and the installit.bat
batch file to install it. By default, everything will be installed under
C:\Program Files\jEdit. If you don't like this, edit the top level
installit.bat file.
