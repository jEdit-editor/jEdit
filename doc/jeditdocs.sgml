 <sect1 id=features><title>jEdit Features</>
  <para>
   jEdit itself aims to provide most of the features needed to edit
   text files. That's it. No IDE features (project manager, etc), no file
   management, no built in e-mail reader (*cough* *cough* emacs). Those
   and other non-essential features can be coded as plugins, which the
   user installs when necessary. Having said that, jEdit still boasts an
   impressive set of features, the most important being:

<chapter id=conventions><title>Conventions Used in This Manual</title>
 <para>
  Keyboard shortcuts and menu items are presented in a certain way
  in this manual. This chapter overviews the conventions used.
 </para>
 <sect1 id=menu-items><title>Menu Items</>
  <indexterm><primary>menu bar</></indexterm>
  <para>
   Because jEdit's menu hierarchy is rather complicated at times, the
   following convention is used to present menu items. First of all, the
   top level menu is listed, followed by successive levels of submenus,
   followed by the menu item itself. All menu components are separated
   by greater-than symbols (<quote>&gt;</>). For example,
   <guimenu>Edit</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Line Operations</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Delete
   Line</> refers to the <guimenuitem>Delete Line</> item of the
   <guisubmenu>Line Operations</> submenu of the <guimenu>Edit</> menu.
  </para>
  <para>
   Menu items that end with an ellipisis (...) display a dialog
   box, and usually provide an option to cancel.
   Other menu items take effect immediately (but they may possibly
   show alerts or errors).
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id=shortcuts><title>Keyboard Shortcuts</>
  <indexterm><primary>keyboard shortcuts</><secondary>
  multiple keystroke</></indexterm>
  <para>
   In jEdit, most operations can be performed from the keyboard.
   Because there are quite a few commands, it is very difficult to
   make them all accessible with one keystroke. So jEdit supports
   multiple keystroke bindings. To invoke a command with a multiple
   keystroke binding, all keystrokes have to be pressed, in order,
   with nothing in between.
  </para>
  <para>
   In this manual, key bindings are written in the form
   <keycombo><keycap>Modifier</><keycap>Key</></keycombo>, where
   <keycap>Modifier</> is the modifier key that must be pressed in
   addition to <keycap>Key</> to invoke that command. When multiple
   keystrokes are present in a binding,they will be listed in order,
   for example the shortcut for <guimenuitem>Open URL</> is
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>O</></keycombo>.
  </para>
 </sect1>
</chapter>
<chapter id=basic-file-ops><title>Basic File Operations</>
 <para>
  This chapter describes jEdit's basic file-related operations, such as
  opening, saving, printing, and so on.
 </para>

  <indexterm><primary>desktop saving</></indexterm>
  <indexterm><primary>keyboard shortcuts</>
  <secondary>for accessing the menu bar</></indexterm>
  <para>
   Exactly how jEdit is started depends on the operating system;
   most often you would type <quote>jedit</quote> at the command line
   or double click on the jEdit icon (or select it from a menu,
   or whatever). Once started, it will print some information messages as
   it loads up, then after a short delay the editor window will appear.
   </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    jEdit accepts various command line parameters; see
    <xref linkend=cli-usage>.
   </para>
  </note>
  <tip>
   <para>
    When started with no file names on the command line, jEdit will
    open any files that were open in the previous session. This can
    be disabled in the <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</>
    dialog box; see <xref linkend=global-opts>.

   <indexterm><primary>Plugins menu</></indexterm>
   <para>
    The labels (Buffers, File, Edit, and so on) that run across
    the top of the editor window are the <firstterm>menus</>. Generally,
    <guimenu>File</> contains global file-related commands,
    <guimenu>Edit</> contains editing commands,
    <guimenu>Search</> contains search &amp; replace commands,
    and <guimenu>Plugins</> contains menus and menu items created
    by plugins.
    </para>
   <para>
    Pressing <keycap>Alt</> in addition to an underlined character in the
    menu bar will display the respective menu. Once a menu is open,
    <keycap>Alt</> in addition to an underlined character in a menu item
    label will invoke that menu item as if it was selected with the mouse,
    and the arrow keys can be used to navigate the menu bar;
    <keycap>Left Arrow</> and <keycap>Right Arrow</> open the previous
    and next menu, respectively, and <keycap>Up Arrow</> and <keycap>Down Arrow</>
    move up and down the currently open menu.

    The strip of buttons underneath the menu bar is called the
    <firstterm>tool bar</>. Moving the mouse pointer over a
    button and holding it still will display a
    <firstterm>tooltip</> - a brief description of the button.

   <indexterm><primary>context menu</></indexterm>
   <indexterm><primary>right-click menu</></indexterm>
   <para>
    Most of the editor window is occupied by the text area. The text area
    displays the contents of the currently opened buffer.
    The two scroll bars can be used to move around the buffer when there
    is more text than can fit on the screen. The blinking red line
    is called the <firstterm>caret</firstterm>. All text editing
    occurs at the caret, and before any text can be changed,
    the caret must be moved to the appropriate position.
   </para>
   <para>
    Notice how the line with the caret is highlighted, and a
    blue dot appears at the end of each line. The current line highlighting
    aids in locating the caret, and the dot is an <firstterm>end of
    line marker</>.
   </para>
   <para>
    The lines painted with red tildes (<quote>~</quote>)
    are <firstterm>invalid lines</firstterm> - they are visible,
    but don't actually exist in the document. In the case of the
    example document shown in the screen shot, all visible lines after the
    first two are invalid because the document only has two lines.
   </para>
   <para>
    Clicking the text area with the right mouse button will
    display the <firstterm>context menu</>, which contains frequently-used
    editing commands.
   </para>
   <tip>
    <para>
     Many characteristics of the text area can be changed in the
     <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box;

  <sect2 id=status><title>The Status Area</>
   <indexterm><primary>status bar</></indexterm>
   <indexterm><primary>line number display</></indexterm>
   <para>
    The status area is at the very bottom of the editor window. It
    displays a new usage hint every time jEdit is started, as well
    as various information about the caret. The caret information is
    displayed in the following format:
    <screen>30 - 2/2 - 100%</screen>
    The first number is the <firstterm>column position</>, or how
    far the caret is from the start of the line. The second pair of
    numbers is the current line, and the total number of lines in
    the buffer. The third number is the ratio of the current line
    to the total number of lines; ie, where the caret is positioned
    inside the buffer.
   </para>

  <indexterm><primary>saving</></indexterm>
  <para>
   Before a file can be edited, it must first be <firstterm>opened</>.
   When jEdit opens a file, it reads it into memory and creates a
   new <firstterm>buffer</>.
   In this manual, a <firstterm>file</> is the file itself, on disk;
   a <firstterm>buffer</> is an open file as it exists in memory,
   with any unsaved changes, etc.
  </para>
  <para>
   All open buffers are listed in the <guimenu>Buffers</> menu; selecting
   one will make the current view edit it.
  </para>
  <para>
   If a buffer has unsaved changes, the string <quote>(modified)</> will
   be displayed in the title bar. The string will be displayed until the
   buffer is saved (or the changes are discarded by reloading).
  </para>
  <para>
   Sometimes the string <quote>(read only)</>
   will be shown in the title bar. When a buffer is read only, no
   changes can be made. Markers can be set but they will not be saved.
  </para>
  <para>
   Files that you do not have write access to are automatically opened
   read only. Files can also be opened read only from the command line
   by specifying the <userinput>-readonly</> option.
  </para>
  <para>
   To make a read only buffer read-write, save it.
   If the save was successful, the read only flag will be cleared (the
   rationale behind this is that if the save was successful, you have
   write access to the file).

    Any file names passed on the command line are opened by jEdit.
    It is possible to have the caret positioned on a specific line
    after the buffer is opened. For example, to open <filename>paper.tex</>
    and go to line number 247, you would invoke:
    <screen><prompt>$</> <userinput>jedit -+247 paper.tex</></screen>
    Only one line number specification is allowed per command line.
    It is also possible to move the caret to a specific marker.
    For example, to open <filename>Kernel.java</> and go to
    the marker named <filename>getCommandStack</>, you would invoke:
    <screen><prompt>$</> <userinput>jedit Kernel.java#getCommandStack</></screen>
   </para>
   <para>
    If your file name includes a dash (<quote>-</>), you will need
    to specify the <userinput>--</> (dash-dash) command line parameter before
    it so that it is not treated as a command line switch. For
    example:
    <screen><prompt>$</> <userinput>jedit -- -file-name-starting-with-a-dash</></screen>

    will display the file open dialog box. Double clicking (or single

    (keyboard equivalent: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
    <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>O</></keycombo>)
    will display the Open URL dialog box. A URL or a file path name
    (relative path names are prefixed with the current buffer's parent
    directory) can be
    entered. Most Java implementations support the <filename>ftp:</>
    and <filename>http:</> URL protocols, so jEdit can open files from
    the Internet directly. However, saving to URLs is not supported on any
    current Java version.

   <para>
    A special case of opening a file is when you need to create a
    new, blank, file. There are two ways to do this:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>
     <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>New File</> (keyboard equivalent:
     <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>N</></keycombo>) will create a new
     <quote>Untitled</> file.
     <indexterm><primary>untitled files</></indexterm>
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
     Open a non-existent file. If you open a
     non-existent file using any technique described in this
     section, a new file with that name will be created when the buffer
     is first saved.
    </para></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>
  <sect1 id=saving><title>Saving Files</>
  <para>
   <indexterm><primary>buffer</></indexterm>
   <indexterm><primary>saving</></indexterm>
   Any changes made to a buffer aren't actually stored to disk immediately
   (but see autosave below); instead, they are stored in the computer's high
   speed memory (RAM) until they are <firstterm>saved</>.
  </para>
  <sect2><title>Autosave and Backups</>
   <para>
    <indexterm><primary>autosave</></indexterm>
    Because computers crash from time to time, not saving
    changes to disk until the user manually does so is not a very good
    idea; most people don't like having to hit <quote>save</> every 2
    minutes, just in case. So jEdit has an autosave feature that should protect
    against possible disasters. Every 15 seconds, all buffers with changes are
    written out to their respective file names, enclosed in hash
    (<quote>#</>) characters. For example, <filename>program.c</> will
    be autosaved to <filename>#program.c#</>. These autosave files do
    not clutter up your disk; they are deleted when the buffer is explicitly
    saved.
    The point of autosaving is so that if jEdit crashes, it should be
    reasonably easy to recover your work - just open the autosave file(s)
    and copy over the autosaved data.

    Another useful safety feature is file backups. When you save a buffer
    for the first time after opening it, its original contents are
    saved to the buffer's file name suffixed with a tilde (<quote>~</>).
    For example, <filename>paper.tex</> is backed up to <filename>paper.tex~</>.
    The point of backups so that if you make extensive changes to a file that you
    are not happy with, you can go back to the previous version.

    Different operating systems have various conventions for end-of-line

    (\r\n, ^M^J). jEdit can handle all three file formats.

  jEdit works in much the same fashion as any MacOS or Windows text
  editor; if you have used one before, quickly skim this section to pick up
  the few jEdit-specific features. If you are more familiar with a
  Unix editor such as Emacs or VIM, read
  this section more carefully; jEdit works in a slightly different fashion
  to those text editors.

  <para>
   <indexterm><primary>caret</></indexterm>
   <indexterm><primary>moving the caret</>
   <secondary>by clicking the mouse</></indexterm>
   Recall that the caret is the location where most text insertion and
   deletion takes place. Moving the caret is one of the most
   frequently performed operations; there are many different ways
   to do it.
  </para>
  <para>
   Clicking the left or middle mouse button will move the caret to
   the mouse position. This is most useful when moving the caret over
   large distances, where doing it from the keyboard is impractical.
  </para>
  <para>
   <indexterm><primary>moving the caret</>
   <secondary>with the arrow keys</></indexterm>
   Pressing one of the arrow keys will move the caret in the
   respective direction. The <keycap>Up Arrow</> and <keycap>Down Arrow</>
   arrow keys remember the original caret position; for example, if
   the caret is on position 48 of a line, and it is moved up to a line
   which is only 30 characters long, it will end up on position 30.
   If it is <emphasis>immediately</> moved up again to a line that
   is 50 characters long, it will end up back at position 48. The arrow
   keys should be used to move the caret by a few characters or lines.
  </para>

   <indexterm><primary>moving the caret</>
   <secondary>a word at a time</></indexterm>
   <indexterm><primary>moving the caret</>
   <secondary>a paragraph at a time</></indexterm>
   Pressing one of the arrow keys while holding down <keycap>Control</>
   will move backwards or forwards by one word in the case of
   <keycap>Left Arrow</> and <keycap>Right Arrow</>, or backwards or
   forwards by one paragraph in the case of <keycap>Up Arrow</> and
   <keycap>Down Arrow</>. A paragraph is defined as a run of text
   delimited by double newlines. jEdit has no support for indented
   paragraphs, HTML <command>&lt;p&gt;</> tags, etc. These commands
   can be used for moving over longer distances when you want to
   keep your hands on the keyboard.

   <indexterm><primary>moving the caret</>
   <secondary>to the end of the buffer</></indexterm>
   In most text editors, the <keycap>Home</> key moves the caret to the first
   character of the current line, and the <keycap>End</> key moves the
   caret to the last character of the current line. jEdit takes this
   one step further - if the caret is <emphasis>already</> on the first
   or last character of the line, it will be moved to the first or last
   <firstterm>visible position</>, respectively. If it already on the first
   or last visible position, it will be moved to the start or end of
   the buffer.

 <sect1 id=selecting-text><title>Selecting Text</>
  <para>
   <indexterm><primary>selection</></indexterm>
   Often it is necessary to move, delete, or otherwise operate on an
   arbitrary range of characters. With the exception of the line and
   paragraph oriented features, all text editing commands operate on
   the current <firstterm>selection</>. Selected text
   is drawn with a highlight.
  </para>
  <para>
   <indexterm><primary>caret</></indexterm>
   <indexterm><primary>mark</></indexterm>
   A selection is defined as the range of text between the caret and
   the <firstterm>mark</>; when no selection is active, the mark and the
   caret have the same position. When text is selected,
   the mark is at the start of the selection, and the caret is at the
   end.
  </para>
  <para>
   <indexterm><primary>selecting</>
   <secondary>by dragging</></indexterm>
   The easiest way to select text is by dragging from the start of the

   the left or middle mouse button (dragging means pressing the mouse button,
   and moving the mouse without releasing it).
  </para>
  <para>
   <indexterm><primary>selecting</>
   <secondary>words by double-clicking</></indexterm>
   Double clicking the left or middle mouse button will select the

   run of alphanumeric characters.
  </para>
  <para>
   <indexterm><primary>selecting</><secondary>lines by
   triple-clicking</></indexterm>
   Triple clicking the left or middle mouse button will select the

   the line is <emphasis>not</> selected.
  </para>
  <para>
   <indexterm><primary>selecting</>
   <secondary>changing the selection</></indexterm>
   Once you have selected some text, it is sometimes necessary to
   move the caret but not the mark; in other words, enlarge (or shrink)
   the selection. The easiest way to achieve this is to click where you
   want to move the caret (end of the selection) while
   holding down the <keycap>Shift</> key. This can also be used
   to create a selection if none is active; Shift-clicking at a
   location will create a selection from the caret to where you
   clicked.
  </para>
  <para>
   Holding down <keycap>Shift</> in addition to one of the caret
   movement commands (the arrow keys, <keycap>Home</>, <keycap>End</>,
   etc) will extend the selection, instead of just moving the caret.
   Again, this can be used to create a selection if none is active.

   jEdit stores the last 100 editing actions. An editing action is
   either an insertion of text, or deletion. Some commands such as
   <guimenuitem>Replace All</> batch their editing into one action,
   so it can be undone in one go. Keep in mind that if you undo some actions

   If jEdit's RMI interface is enabled (it is by default), jEdit will
   register itself as an RMI service on startup. When a new instance of
   jEdit is opened, it will try connecting to the RMI service first.
  </para>
  <para>
   The end result is that you can start jEdit as many times as necessary,
   but only one copy will actually be open at once. Also, other applications
   can use jEdit's editing services (assuming they know about RMI).

   The <command>-normi</> command line switch disables the RMI interface entirely;
   no connection will be attempted, and no sever will be started. The
   <command>-rmi</> command line switch can be used to change the name
   jEdit registers itself with in the registry. This can be used when
   you want to run more than one copy of jEdit at once. For example:
   <screen>
<prompt>$</> <userinput>jedit -rmi=my_jedit_instance_number_2</>
   </screen>
   The same <command>-rmi</> parameter must be passed to <emphasis>both</>
   the server and client.

   A marker is a named location in a buffer. There can be any number

   the file hidden on Unix systems.
  </para>
  <para>
   Markers are always stored sorted according to their position in the

  <para>
   Because it is impossible to provide optimal editing for all types of
   files at once, jEdit provides various <firstterm>edit modes</>. An edit mode
   is an editor configuration suitable for editing a specific
   type of file. Edit modes can specify syntax highlighting, auto indent,
   and various other settings for editing a file type.
  </para>
  <sect2><title>Automatic Mode Selection</>
   <para>
    <indexterm><primary>file name extensions</></indexterm>
    When a file is opened, jEdit uses various techniques to guess the
    most appropriate edit mode. First of all, it checks the file's
    <quote>extension</> (the part after the last period, if there is
    one). For example, files whose names end with
    <quote>.c</> are edited in C mode. Then, it checks the entire
    <emphasis>file name</> against a list of known file names. For
    example, a file named <quote>CONFIG.SYS</> will be
    edited in DOS INI mode. Finally, the first line of the file is
    checked. For example, if the first line of
    a file is <quote>#!/bin/sh</>, (signifying a Unix shell script)
    the file will be edited in Shell Script mode.

   <para>
    If none of those techniques are appropriate, the edit mode can
    be specified manually. To set the current buffer's edit mode
    on a one-time basis, select the edit mode in the
    <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Buffer Options</> dialog box;
    see <xref linkend=buffer-opts>.
    To have a buffer open with a specific edit mode every time,
    set the <quote>mode</> buffer-local property to the
    <firstterm>internal</> name of the desired edit mode by placing
    the following text in one of the first 10 lines of the buffer:
    <screen>
:mode=<replaceable>edit mode</>:

    The strings used for wing commenting can be changed using buffer-local
    properties. For example, placing the following in the first 10 lines
    of a buffer will change the wing comment characters to <quote>(*</> and
    <quote>*)</>:
    <screen>:commentStart=(*:commentEnd=*):</screen>

    <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>K</></keycombo>) will enclose the
    selection with comment start and end strings, and places the box
    comment string at the start of each line. An example of C++
    box commented code looks like so:
    <screen>/* Process *proc = Process::getThisProcess();
* proc-&gt;getMainThread()-&gt;postMessage(msg);
* proc-&gt;getThread("__gui")-&gt;sendPulse(P_WAKE_UP); */</screen>
    The strings used for box commenting can be changed using buffer-local
    properties. For example, placing the following in the first 10 lines
    of a buffer will change the box comment characters to <quote>(*</> and
    <quote>*</>), with <quote>(-</> placed at the start of each line:
    <screen>:commentStart=(*:commentEnd=*):boxComment=(-:</screen>

    (keyboard equivalent: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
    <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>B</></keycombo>) will place the
    block comment character at the start of each line in the selection.
    An example of C++ block commented code looks like so:
    <screen>
// Process *proc = Process::getThisProcess();
// proc-&gt;getMainThread()-&gt;postMessage(msg);
// proc-&gt;getThread("__gui")-&gt;sendPulse(P_WAKE_UP);
    </screen>
    The string used for block commenting can be changed using buffer-local
    properties. For example, placing the following in the first 10 lines
    of a buffer will change the box comment characters to <quote>--</>:
    <screen>

 <sect1 id=indent><title>Tabbing and Indentation</>
  <para>
   A <firstterm>tab</> is a special character that moves the caret to
   the next tab stop. Many programming languages rely
   on tabs to indent lines of source depending on how deeply they
   are nested in the code. jEdit has several features that make
   tabs and indentation easier to deal width.
  </para>
  <sect2><title>Changing the Tab Width</>
   <indexterm><primary>buffer-local properties</>
   <secondary>tabSize</></indexterm>
   <indexterm><primary>tab width</></indexterm>
   <para>
    Many believe that the One True Tab Size is 8, others think that
    all code should be indented with a tab width of 4, and the GNU
    Project refuses to accept code with a tab width of anything but 2.
   </para>
   <para>
    There are three ways to change the tab size:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>The tab size can be changed on a global basis in
     the Editor tab of the <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box;

     <listitem><para>The tab size can be changed in the current buffer

     </para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>The tab size can be changed in the current buffer
     for future editing sessions by setting the <quote>tabSize</>
     buffer-local property to the desired tab size, by placing the
     following in the first 10 lines of the buffer:
     <screen>:tabSize=<replaceable>n</>:</screen>
     Where <replaceable>n</> is of course the desired tab size.
     </para></listitem>

   <para>
    <indexterm><primary>soft tabs</></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>buffer-local properties</>
    <secondary>noTabs</></indexterm>
    Some people prefer using multiple spaces to indent code, instead of
    <quote>real</> tabs. The main advantage of this is that
    the file will still be readable if viewed with a different default
    tab size. jEdit supports this with its <quote>Soft Tabs</>
    feature. If the <keycap>Tab</> key is pressed with soft tabs enabled,
    the number of spaces necessary to move the caret to the next tab
    stop will be inserted, instead of a <quote>real</> tab.
   </para>
   <para>
    There are three ways to use soft tabs:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>Soft tabs can be selected on a global basis in the

    Pressing <keycap>Tab</> or <keycap>Space</> at the start of every

    an auto indent feature.
   </para>
   <para>
    If indent on enter is enabled, pressing the <keycap>Enter</> key
    will create a new line, and insert the appropriate amount of
    indent automatically. This is similar to the way
    <application>VIM</> performs indentation.
   </para>
   <para>
    If indent on tab is enabled, pressing the <keycap>Tab</> key on
    an unindented line will insert the appropriate amount of
    indentation. Pressing it again will insert a tab (or a soft tab).
    This is similar to the way <application>emacs</> performs
    indentation.
   </para>
   <para>
    By default, indent on enter is disabled and indent on tab is
    enabled. There are three ways to specify when indentation should be
    performed:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>Indent on enter and tab can be set on a global
     basis in the Editor tab of the <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</>
     dialog box; see <xref linkend=global-opts>.</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>Indent on enter and tab can be set in the
     current buffer for the duration of the editing session in the
     <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Buffer Options</> dialog box;

     </para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>Indent on enter and tab can be set in the
     current buffer for future editing sessions using buffer-local
     properties by placing the following in the first 10 lines of a buffer:
     <screen>:indentOnEnter=<replaceable>flag</>:indentOnTab=<replaceable>flag</>:</screen>
     Where <replaceable>flag</> is either <quote>on</> or <quote>off</>.
     </para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>
   <para>
    The amount of indentation is mode-specific. In most edit modes,
    it is always the indent of the previous line. However, in C, C++,
    Java and JavaScript modes, if the previous line contains an open
    curly bracket (<quote>{</>), an extra tab (or soft tab) is inserted.
    Similarly, if the <emphasis>current</> line contains a
    closing curly bracket (<quote>}</>), a level of indentation is
    removed.
   </para>
   <para>
    The indentation brackets can be changed using buffer-local properties.
    When editing Lisp code, you might try placing the following in the
    first 10 lines of the buffer:
    <screen>:indentOpenBrackets=(:indentCloseBrackets=):</screen>

   When jEdit loads a file, it checks the first 10 lines for
   colon-enclosed name/value pairs. The following example
   will set the tab size to 8 characters, enable soft tabs, and set
   the default edit mode of the file to Perl:
   <screen>:noTabs=yes:tabSize=8:mode=perl:</screen>
   Buffer-local properties take effect the next time the file is opened.

   jEdit scans two directories for plugins on startup;
   the system-wide plugin directory, where plugins that are to be available
   to all users can be placed, and the other is the user-specific plugin
   directory, where plugins for a specific user can be placed.
  </para>
  <para>
   Plugins are distributed as ZIP or GZipped TAR files. Uncompressing
   them will result in a JAR file named <filename><replaceable>Plugin</>.jar</>,
   and a directory named by the plugin. The JAR file can be made available
   for jEdit by moving it into one of the two plugin directories. The
   directory contains source code for the plugin, which isn't necessary
   for normal usage.

The following is required to use this plugin:
        JDK version >= 1.1
        jEdit version >= 2.0pre8</screen>
   This is a simple example; some plugins might not only depend on
   a jEdit and JDK version, but also other plugins and class libraries.
   When an unsatisfied dependency is found, all

<chapter id=developing-plugins><title>Developing Plugins</>
 <para>
  This chapter overviews jEdit plugin development. A knowlege
  of Java is assumed. Because plugins can call all Java APIs and do a
  rather large number of things, describing all the things that can be done
  is out of the scope of this manual; only the basics are covered here.
 </para>

  </para>
  <para>
   jEdit only loads two types of entries from JARs - property files and
   classes. Property files must have a filename extension <quote>.props</>.
   They are loaded and added to jEdit's property list. Java class files
   are loaded on demand.

   class. Properties set with the <filename>setProperty()</> method will
   be saved to the user properties file; those set with <filename>setDefaultProperty()</>
   will not.
  </para>
  <para>
   Certain properties are fetched by jEdit to obtain information about
   plugins. Currently, these informational properties are only used by
   the help system (all the properties must be specified for the plugin
   to appear in the help). In these properties, <replaceable>plugin</> is
   the class name of the Plugin instance:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para>

    plugin can be found. This should be an HTML document
   </para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   Plugin dependencies are also specified using properties. jEdit checks
   properties named <filename>plugin.<replaceable>plugin</>.depend.<replaceable>n</>
   </filename>, where <replaceable>n</> is a number, starting from 0. All
   dependencies must be numbered in a continuous sequence. Dependency
   entries consist of the dependency class, followed by an argument.
   The supported dependency classes are:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para>
    <filename>jedit</>: the argument is the internal
    version of jEdit that this plugin requires. The internal version
    number of a jEdit release is listed in the <filename>jEdit.java</>
    source file.
   </para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>
    <filename>jdk</>: the argument is the JDK version required by this
    plugin. Currently, this can only be 1.1 or 1.2.
   </para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>
    <filename>class</>: the argument is the full name of a class required
    for this plugin to work. This can be used to ensure that a certain class
    library is installed, by adding a <filename>class</> entry with one
    of the classes from that library.
   </para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   A sample dependency entry for a plugin that requires JDK 1.1, jEdit 2.0pre8

  <para>
   <filename>start()</> is called for each plugin at the very end of
   jEdit's startup sequence. Commands and edit modes should be registered
   in the <filename>start()</> method, and other startup tasks should be

   Each jEdit command is an instance of a class extending
   <filename>org.gjt.sp.jedit.EditAction</>. The EditAction class is defined
   as follows:
  </para>
  <programlisting>public class EditAction implements ActionListener
{
        public EditAction(String name);
        public String getName();
        public abstract void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt);
        public static View getView(ActionEvent evt);
        public static Buffer getBuffer(ActionEvent evt);
}</programlisting>
  <para>
   The constructor must be passed a name for this edit action. The
   <filename>getName()</> method can be used to obtain it. The
   <filename>actionPerformed()</> method is called when the action is
   invoked, either from the keyboard or with mouse. It can call
   the <filename>getView()</> and <filename>getBuffer()</> methods,
   passing them the action event, to obtain the view and buffer that
   the action was invoked from.
  </para>
  <para>
   The following properties are fetched by jEdit to obtain information
   about edit actions, where <replaceable>action</> is the name of the
   action in question:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para>
    <filename><replaceable>action</>.label</>: the menu item label for
    this action. If a dollar sign (<quote>$</>) appears in the string,
    the next character becomes the menu item mnemonic. The dollar sign
    does not appear in the menu item label, but the next character
    does.
   </para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>
    <filename><replaceable>action</>.shortcut</>: (optional) the keyboard
    shortcut for this action. The format of keyboard shortcuts is
    described in <xref linkend=options-shortcuts>. Specifying keyboard
    shortcuts in plugins is discouraged; a future jEdit release may
    use those keys for its own commands.
   </para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   Plugin edit actions must be registered with jEdit to appear in the
   <guimenu>Plugins</> menu. If you want the action be be a menu item
   in the <guimenu>Plugins</> menu, call the <filename>addPluginAction()</>
   method of the <filename>org.gjt.sp.jedit.jEdit</> class.
  </para>
  <para>
   To add a submenu with multiple menu items in it, first define a
   property with a list of actions, and a property with the menu label.
   An example:
  </para>
  <programlisting>sample-menu=action-1 - action-2 action-3
sample-menu.label=Sample Plugin Menu</programlisting>
  <para>
   Note that <quote>-</> can be used to insert a separator.
   Then in the plugin's <filename>start()</> method, call
   <filename>addAction()</> (<emphasis>not</> <filename>addPluginAction()</>)
   for each action, followed by
   <filename>addPluginMenu()</> with the name of the menu property.
   An example:
  </para>
  <programlisting>public void start()
{
        jEdit.addAction(new action_1());
        jEdit.addAction(new action_2());
        jEdit.addAction(new action_3());
        jEdit.addPluginMenu("sample-menu");
}</programlisting>
 <tip>
  <para>
   All jEdit edit actions have all-lowercase class names, with words
   separated by underscores (<quote>_</>), and all-lowercase action
   names, with words separated by dashes (<quote>-</>). It is best to
   follow this convention in your own plugins.

  </para>
  <para>
   The <filename>getView()</> method of the <filename>org.gjt.sp.jedit.EditAction</> class
   takes one parameter, an event object fired from
   a view. This method then walks the component hierarchy of the
   event source and returns that view.
   This is the most frequently used to get the view that invoked an action
   in the <filename>actionPerformed()</>.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <filename>getViews()</> method of the <filename>org.gjt.sp.jedit.jEdit</> class
   is an alternative way to obtain a view to work with. It
   returns an array of all open views.
  </para>
  <para>
   Once you have a view instance, several methods can be used to operate on
   that view. One of the most frequently used ones is
   <filename>getTextArea()</> which returns the <filename>org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.JEditTextArea</>
   instance in this view. The text area can be used to obtain the selection,
   move the caret, etc.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <filename>getBuffer()</> method returns the buffer being edited
   by this view. The buffer instance can be used to make changes, save,
   and so on.
  </para>

 <sect1 id=plugin-buffers><title>Controlling Buffers</>
  <para>
   jEdit stores buffers as instances of the <filename>org.gjt.sp.jedit.Buffer</>
   class. Internally, they are stored in a link list, but plugins cannot
   access that list directly.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <filename>getBuffer()</> method of the <filename>org.gjt.sp.jedit.View</>
   class returns the buffer being edited by that view.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <filename>getBuffers()</> method of the <filename>org.gjt.sp.jedit.jEdit</>
   class returns an array of all open buffers.
  </para>
  <para>
   Because the Buffer class extends <filename>javax.swing.text.PlainDocument</>,
   all the standard document methods such as <filename>insertString()</>
   and <filename>remove()</>.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id=writing-modes><title>Writing New Edit Modes</>
  <para>
   Each jEdit edit mode is an instance of the <filename>org.gjt.sp.jedit.Mode</>
   class. The Mode class is defined as follows:
  </para>
  <programlisting>public class Mode
{
        public Mode(String name);
        public String getName();
        public void enter(Buffer buffer);
        public void enterView(View view);
        public void leave(Buffer buffer);
        public void leaveView(View view);
        public boolean indentLine(Buffer buffer, View view, int caret);
        public TokenMarker createTokenMarker();
}</programlisting>
  <para>
   The constructor must be passed a name for this edit mode. The
   <filename>getName()</> method can be used to obtain it. The
   <filename>enter()</> and <filename>enterView()</> methods are
   called when a buffer enters this mode, and when a view is set to
   edit a buffer with this mode, respectively. The <filename>leave()</>
   and <filename>leaveView()</> methods
   are called when a buffer or view leaves the mode.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <filename>indentLine()</> method is called when a line needs to
   be indented, usually when the <keycap>Tab</> or <keycap>Enter</> keys
   are pressed. The implementation provided in the Mode class preforms the
   default auto indent. Only override this method if something more
   complicated needs to be performed.

<appendix id=cli-usage><title>Command Line Usage</>
 <para>
  When jEdit is started, it opens any files specified on the
  command line, and parses the options. An option is a command
  line argument that begins with <quote>-</>. To open a file
  whose name begins with <quote>-</>, specify <quote>--</> on
  the command line before the file name. The <quote>--</>
  switch makes jEdit ignore any remaining command line switches
  and interpret them as file names.

<appendix id=jedit-history><title>History of jEdit</>
 <para>
  Open Source projects are often started with the author <quote>scratching
  an itch</>; for example, some programmer itching for a good mail client
  might write one. jEdit, however, started as more of an experimental
  hack. I never intended it to be useful; its growth and popularity was
  completely unexpected to me.
 </para>
 <bridgehead renderas=sect2>Early Efforts</>
 <para>
  One can say that jEdit started as early as 1996.
  My first effort at writing an editor, and in fact my first effort
  at writing a real Java program, was an application called
  <application>JavaJot</>. The source code totalled to about 5 kilobytes;
  JavaJot wasn't about to compete with emacs any time soon. I posted
  JavaJot to my homepage, but didn't get a single e-mail about it (no
  surprise either)
 </para>
 <para>
  Nearly a year later (late 1997/early 1998) when I got a PC, I started
  hacking in Java 1.1. I downloaded several Java 1.1 applications, to see how
  the new features be used. One that particularly
  impressed me was John Jensen's <application>TextEdit</>.
  It's most interesting feature was a plugin system; it could
  load external JAR files to extend the editor. TextEdit got me into
  text editors again. I liked TextEdit, but knew I could do better.
 </para>
 <para>
  I began coding <quote>JEdit</> (note
  that the first character was capitalized, unlike today's
  <quote>jEdit</>). I implemented a plugin system similar to TextEdit's,
  and added many other features that TextEdit lacked, such as
  multiple document support. JEdit was never released to the public;
  I felt that there were so many other trivial Java text editors out
  there, that JEdit wouldn't make much of a difference.
 </para>
 <para>
  One of the reasons JEdit remained trivial was that at the time,
  the AWT sucked. Writing complex GUIs was too hard and often one had
  to write their own components, from scratch, to go beyond the very
  basic capabilities offered by the AWT. So when Swing 1.0 was released,
  promising rich, lightweight, customizable components,
  I immediately downloaded it. I was impressed. So impressed that I
  wrote an another editor, this time using Swing. I called it JE. It went
  far beyond the original JEdit in features, and was better than many
  Java editors available at the time.
 </para>
 <para>
  However, I never released JE either; it had too many limitations and
  flaws, mostly because I didn't know Swing very well at the time.
 </para>
 <bridgehead renderas=sect2>Third Time Lucky</>
 <para>
  What I started coding next became the nowadays jEdit. I copied
  the <quote>good</> bits from JE, such as the plugin system, and
  rewrote the rest from scratch. I also released early and often. After I
  implemented file loading, saving, and several other fundamental
  features, I released the first jEdit with a <quote>version number</>;
  I called it jEdit 0.2.
 </para>
 <para>
  After jEdit 0.2, I released several more 0.x versions which implemented
  more basic functionality, such as search and replace.
  I started announcing jEdit on the Linux
  news site <quote>freshmeat</>. This heightened publicity attracted
  several people, including those from the FreeBuilder Java IDE
  project (and in fact, nowadays FreeBuilder uses jEdit's text component).
 </para>
 <bridgehead renderas=sect2>jEdit 1.0 and 1.1</>
 <para>
  jEdit 1.0 was released around September 1998. At the time, it
  was basically a Windows Notepad work-alike/clone,
  with several additional features such as auto indent (and the plugin
  system of course). Around the time of 1.0's release, the jEdit mailing
  list had 2 or 3 members. jEdit 1.1 was released approximately one month
  later, but it was a relatively minor update.
 </para>
 <bridgehead renderas=sect2>jEdit 1.2</>
 <para>
  After 1.1, things started to get interesting.
  I was having an e-mail discussion with Tal Davidson
  (author of JStyle and Artistic Style) about syntax
  highlighting. As a quick  hack, he wrote a syntax parser
  called <application>JSTokenMarker</>.
  I integrated it into jEdit immediately.
  jEdit 1.2pre2 was the first release with syntax highlighting, but
  it didn't cause much of a stir because it was unstable and slow.
 </para>
 <para>
  I continued enhancing JSTokenMarker throughout the 1.2 pre-releases.
  At version 1.2pre7, it was pretty stable, and it supported
  HTML and various other file types. Unfortunately, it was too slow, so
  with 1.2pre8 I rewrote it from scratch. I scrapped Tal's original
  code (sorry :) ) and wrote my own system, thinking it over more
  carefully for speed. The result was much better; it was fast enough
  to be usable.
 </para>
 <para>
  Another major change that occurred in the 1.2 series is the switch
  to Swing 1.1. This made jEdit compatible with JDK 1.2, and jEdit
  benefited from Swing 1.1's improved performance and features.
 </para>
 <para>
  By the time 1.2final was released, it had a pretty functional syntax
  highlighting system, and there were
  about 30 members on the list. I also started using jEdit as my
  primary text editor around this time. So jEdit was no longer a stupid hack;
  it was something that I actually used.
 </para>
 <bridgehead renderas=sect2>Beyond 1.2</>
 <para>
  jEdit 1.3 and later added many, many exciting features, and interest
  in jEdit increased; various commercial projects are now using the syntax
  highlighting system, and as of the time of writing, the mailing list
  has over 200 members. However, nothing really noteworthy happened
  after 1.2; once a program builds up critical mass, things tend to
  settle down a bit.
 </para>
 <para>
  One thing worth mentioning is that the first plugin not written by me
  appeared only after 1.3final was released, even though jEdit had a plugin
  system from the very start. That first plugin was the Accent Converter
  plugin by Romain Guy. (Thanks :) ). For a while, it was the only third-party
  plugin, but after 1.5final, a slow but steady trickle started coming in.
