9. Customizing Menus
--------------------
If you don't like jEdit's default menus, it is possible to change them. 
This involves changing properties, so read props.txt first. 

The main menubar is stored in the editor_mbar property. It is a white 
space separated list of menus.

	editor_mbar=file edit plugins buffers help

For each menu, there is one property with the list of menu items, and 
one with the menu's label.

	file=new_file new_view open_file open_url open_selection \
	%open_recent - ... and so on ...
	file.label=File

If a menu item `-' is found, a separator is inserted. If a menu item 
starts with `%', a menu is inserted in it's place. For example, 
`%open_recent' will insert the `open_recent' submenu. 

Each menu item which is not a separator or a submenu has one property 
which contains it's label and one which contains it's shortcut.

	new_file.label=New File
	new_file.shortcut=C-n

When that menu item is selected, it's name is executed as a command - 
the `new_file' menu item, when selected, will invoke the `new_file' 
command.
