8. Customizing Menus
--------------------
If you don't like jEdit's default menus, it is possible to change them. This
involves changing properties, so read props.txt first.

The main menubar is stored in the editor_mbar property. It is a white space
separated list of menus.

	editor_mbar=file edit plugins buffers help

For each menu, there is one property with the list of menu items, and one
with the menu's label.

	file=new_file new_view open_file open_url open_selection \
	%open_recent - ... and so on ...

If a menu item `-' is found, a separator is inserted. If a menu item starts
with `%', a menu is inserted in it's place. For example, `%open_recent' will
insert the `open_recent' submenu.

Each menu item which is not a separator or a submenu has one property which
contains it's label and one which contains it's shortcut.

	new_file.label=New File
	new_file.shortcut=C-n

When that menu item is selected, it's name is executed as a command - the
`new_file' menu item, when selected, will invoke the `new_file' command.

The shortcut format is described in section 1.
