<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

jEdit has many features useful for editing program source code,
including bracket matching, auto indent and several commands for
commenting and uncommenting code. While they don't count as programs
some of the information in this document applies to HTML and TeX files too.

<a name=bracket>
<h1>Bracket Matching</h1>
</a>

Most programming languages make extensive use of brackets to delimit
code blocks and lists. Mismatched brackets are probably the most
common syntax error. jEdit has the following features to help prevent this:

<ul>
<li><b>Bracket highlighting</b> - if the character before the caret is
a bracket ((, ), [, ], {, }) the matching one is highlighted.
<li><b>`Edit-&gt;Locate Bracket' command</b> - this command complements
the previous item nicely. When invoked, it moves the caret to the bracket
matching the one before the caret. If there is no matching bracket, jEdit
will beep.
<li><b>`Edit-&gt;Code Block Operations-&gt;Select Code Block' command</b> -
this command locates the closest opening and closing brackets around the
caret, and selects everything in between. Invoking it again selects the
next outer code block, and so on. If there aren't any matching brackets
around the caret, the entire document will be selected.
</ul>

<a name=autoindent>
<h1>Indentation</h1>
</a>

<h2>Automatic Indentation</h2>
Most programming languages make extensive use of multiple levels of
indentation. Pressing Tab or Space multiple times at the start of every
line is very tedious, so jEdit provides an auto indent feature.<p>

When Tab is first pressed on a line, the appropriate amount of indent is
inserted - usually the indent of the previous non-empty line, but
some modes have more complicated algorithms. When Tab is pressed on a line
which already has the right amount of indent, a real Tab is inserted.<p>

In the C, C++, Java and JavaScript edit modes, auto indent handles curly
brackets ({, }) by shifting the indent in the appropriate direction when
Tab is pressed on a line which contains them. To enable bracket indent
in edit modes other than those above, set the `openIndentBrackets' and
`closeIndentBrackets' buffer-local properties to a list of opening and
closing brackets to indent. For example, When editing Lisp you might
specify the following in one of the first 10 lines of your Lisp file:
<blockquote><code>
:openIndentBrackets=(:closingIndentBrackets=):
</code></blockquote>
The above example doesn't demonstrate this, but multiple brackets can also
be specified in both lists.

<h2>Changing the Tab Width</h2>

The Tab width can be specified on either a global or file-by-file basis.
<ul>
<li>To set the tab width for all files edited within jEdit, specify the
desired width in `Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Editor'.
<li>To set the tab width on a file-by-file basis, set the `tabSize'
buffer-local property to the desired size, for example by putting the
following in one of the first 10 lines of the file:
<blockquote><code>:tabSize=4:</code></blockquote>
Of course replacing 4 with the desired tab size.<p>
</ul>

<h2>Soft Tabs</h2>

If you prefer to use `soft' tabs - ie, multiple spaces inserted when
you press Tab, you can do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>To enable soft tabs for all files edited within jEdit, specify so in
`Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Editor'.
<li>To enable soft tabs on a file-by-file basis, set the `noTabs' buffer-local
property to `yes', for example by putting the following in one of the first 10
lines of the file:
<blockquote><code>:noTabs=yes:</code></blockquote>
</ul>

<h2>Indentation-Related Commands</h2>

The following commands are useful when editing indented files:

<ul>
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Code Block Operations-&gt;Shift Indent Left</b> - removes one
leading Tab (either real or emulated via spaces) from the start of the every
line of the selection (or the current line if nothing is selected)
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Code Block Operations-&gt;Shift Indent Right</b> - does the
opposite of the above, adding one Tab to the leading indent of every line
of the selection. If soft tabs are enabled (see above) an emulated tab
will be inserted instead.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Spaces to Tabs</b> - converts consecutive spaces to tabs
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Tabs to Spaces</b> - converts tabs to `soft' tabs
</ul>

<a name=colorizing>
<h1>Syntax Colorizing</h1>
</a>

jEdit does syntax colorizing for several file types; see the
<a href=advanced.html#modes>Edit Modes</a> help topic for details.<p>

Syntax colorizing makes errors such as misplaced quotes, mispelt
keywords, etc easier to see. It also makes complex program source
easier to read.<p>

<b>Hint:</b> syntax colorizing is performed when printing, too.

<a name=comment>
<h1>Commenting and Uncommenting</h1>
</a>

Most programming languages support comments, which are ignored by
the language's compiler/interpreter. jEdit has the following commands for
commenting and uncommenting text:

<ul>
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Code Block Operations-&gt;Wing Comment</b> - surrounds the
selection with comment start and end strings. Only works in edit
modes which define comment start and end strings. An example of
wing commented Java code:
<pre>
	/* doSomething();
	System.out.println("Done.");
	System.exit(0); */
</pre>
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Code Block Operations-&gt;Block Comment</b> - places comment
to end of line strings at the start of every line of the selection. Only works
in edit modes which define comment to end of line strings. An
example of block commented Java code:
<pre>
	// doSomething();
	// System.out.println("Done.");
	// System.exit(0);
</pre>
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Code Block Operations-&gt;Box Comment</b> - surrounds the
selection with comment start and end strings, and places the box
comment strings at the start of every line of the selection. An example
of box commented Java code:
<pre>
	/* doSomething();
	* System.out.println("Done.");
	* System.exit(0); */
</pre>
<!--<li><b>Edit-&gt;Code Block Operations-&gt;Uncomment</b> - tries to remove
any comment strings from the start and end of every line of the selection.-->
</ul>

The comment characters can be reassigned on a file-by-file basis by
placing something like the following in one of the first 10 lines of the
file:
<blockquote><code>:commentStart=(*:commentEnd=*):<br>
:blockComment=->:boxComment=**:</code></blockquote>

</body>
</html>
</ul>
