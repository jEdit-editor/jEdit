<h1>User Interface Improvements</h1>
</a>

<ul>
<li>
The `console' (component for invoking external commands) is no longer a
separate window, instead each view has one built in. The
`Tools-&gt;Show/Hide Console' command can be used to toggle it's visibility.

<li>
The history text field component has been changed to display it's choices
as a combo box, instead of the non-intutive arrow key system previous
versions used.

<li>
In previous versions, `Search-&gt;Find Selection' searched for the
selected string immediately. Now, it displays a new search &amp; replace
dialog, with the selected string already entered.

<li>
URLs entered in the console are now opened in the editor (for example,
try entering file:C:\autoexec.bat).

<li>
The options dialog box has a new color settings pane.

<li>
Menu items and the tool bar have a new look.

</ul>

<a name=backups>
<h1>Backup System Improvements</h1>
</a>

The backup filename prefix and suffix, and the directory where backups are
saved can now be specified in the options.

<a name=buffer>
<h1>Buffer Options Dialog Box</h1>
</a>

A new `Tools-&gt;Buffer Options' command displays a dialog box for setting
the tab size and soft tabs setting on a per-buffer basis. The edit mode
and line separator can also be set in that dialog.

<a name=plugin>
<h1>New Plugin Loader and API</h1>
</a>

A new interface is provided that plugins must implement. It allows for
greater flexibility, and provides hooks for future features such as
enabling/disabling plugins on the fly and getting information about
plugins at runtime.<p>

The class loader has been completely overhauled. It is now much faster
because it only loads classes as they're needed - previous versions loaded
all classes in one go.

<a name=syntax>
<h1>Modular Syntax Colorizing Package</h1>
</a>

The syntax colorizing code is now completely modular and independent of
jEdit, which means that other Java applications can use it to get
syntax colorizing capabilities.

<a name=bugs>
<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>
</a>

jEdit 1.5 fixes the following bugs present in 1.4:

<ul>
<li>HistoryTextField had several problems, using the history to make a
selection would often leave the text field in a weird state
<li>`File-&gt;Line Separator' menu wasn't updated for all views editing
a buffer
<li>The current file wasn't restored properly by the session management
code
<li>Print command would sometimes print stuff other than the file name in
page headers
<li>`.cmd' files are no longer edited in batch file mode because they
have a different syntax
<li>Batch file token marker colorized stuff like C:\bob\fred.exe incorrectly
<li>Invalid file names in compiler errors caused problems
<li>Reload command didn't clear the dirty flag and could throw an array
index out of bounds exception
<li>Non-existent files are no longer opened twice by the console
</ul>
