Contents
--------
1. Server Updates
2. Buffer Closing Changed
3. Buffer Local Properties
4. Netscape Remote Updates
5. Expand Abbreviation Command

1. Server Updates
-----------------
With jEdit 1.2, jOpen is no more. jEdit automatically connects to the server
if it is running. This can be turned off with the -noserver' switch.

2. Buffer Closing Changed
-------------------------
With jEdit 1.2, views switch to the previous, rather than the first buffer
when the current buffer is closed.

3. Buffer Local Properties
--------------------------
Some properties such as tab size, edit mode and various mode-specific values
can now be set on a per-file basis.

4. Netscape Remote Updates
--------------------------
The `Open in Netscape' command now prompts if the file should be saved first
if there are unsaved changes.

5. Expand Abbreviation Command
------------------------------
This command is very useful - it finds the previous occurance of the current
word and completes it at the caret. For example, if you type `jE' and push
C-/, you will get `jEdit', assuming that it appears previously in the file.
(Similar to the Meta-/ command in emacs).
