<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

This file outlines some of the more advanced features available in jEdit
such as the server and desktop file, edit modes, the anchor and markers,
various `advanced' commands and search and replace.

<a name=server>
<h1>The jEdit Server</h1>
</a>

When jEdit is first started, it creates a new server thread that listens
on a free TCP/IP socket. Subsequent invocations of jEdit connect to that
socket and inform it of any files that are to be opened. This technique
cuts down on memory usage because there is only one instance of jEdit open
at any one time.

The server can be disabled either on a `one-time' basis with the
`-noserver' switch, or permanently in `Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General'.

<a name=desktop>
<h1>The Desktop File</h1>
</a>

When jEdit exits it saves the list of open files to the `desktop' file,
so that the next time jEdit is started with no command line parameters,
it can reopen those files.<p>

The desktop can be disabled either on a `one-time' basis with the
`-nodesktop' switch, or permanently in `Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General'.

<a name=modes>
<h1>Edit Modes</h1>
</a>

Because it is impossible to provide optimal editing for all file types
at once, jEdit supports edit modes. Each edit mode defines indentation,
syntax colorizing patterns, and various settings such as default compiler,
comment strings, and so on.<p>

To determine which edit mode to use for a file, jEdit looks at the file
name, file extension, and first line of the file. If neither of these
methods are suitable, the mode can be specified `manually'; either for
the current session by selecting it from the `Tools-&gt;Mode' menu, or
permanently by entering the following in one of the first 10 lines
of the file whose edit mode you want to set:
<blockquote><code>(:mode=sh:)</code></blockquote>
Of course, <i>sh</i> should be the <b>internal</b> name of the desired edit
mode.<p>

The following table lists all edit modes included with jEdit; additional
ones may be available, depending on the plugins installed.

<table border=3>

<tr>
<th bgcolor=#ccccff>Name</th><th bgcolor=#ccccff>Internal Name</th>
<th bgcolor=#ccccff>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Text</td> <td>none</td> <td>(Yes, the internal name is `none'.) For
editing plain text. Does not do anything special. Automatically selected
for files without a specific edit mode.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>AMSTeX</td> <td>amstex</td> <td>For editing AMSTeX files. This mode
is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.tex' and
which contain `\documentstyle' in the first 100 lines, but which do not
contain `\begin'. Default compiler is `amstex'.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Auto Indent</td> <td>autoindent</td> <td>Implements semi-intelligent
indentation. All other modes except for Text, HTML, Patch and the TeX family
subclass this.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Batch File</td> <td>bat</td> <td>For editing MS-DOS Batch Files. This
mode is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.bat'.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>C</td> <td>c</td> <td>For editing C source. This
mode is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.c' or `.h'.
Default compiler is `cc'.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>C++</td> <td>cc</td> <td>For editing C++ source. This
mode is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.cc',
`.hh', `.cpp', `.cxx', `.C' or `.H' (sometimes I wish the C++ file
extensions were more standard). Default compiler is `c++'.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>HTML</td> <td>html</td> <td>For editing HTML files. This
mode is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.html',
`.htm' or `.shtml'.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Java</td> <td>java_mode</td> <td>For editing Java source. This
mode is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.java'.
Default compiler is `javac'.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>JavaScript</td> <td>javascript</td> <td>For editing JavaScript source. This
mode is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.js'. Also,
HTML mode uses this mode to colorize scripts inside &lt;script&gt; tags.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LaTeX</td> <td>latex</td> <td>For editing LaTeX files. This
mode is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.tex' and
that contain `\begin' in the first 100 lines. Default compiler is `latex'.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Makefile</td> <td>make</td> <td>For editing Makefiles. This
mode is automatically selected for files named `Makefile'.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Patch (DIFF)</td> <td>patch</td> <td>For editing Unix-style patches
and diffs. This mode is automatically selected for files whose names end
with `.diff' or `.patch'.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Properties/INI</td> <td>props</td> <td>For editing Java property files
and MS-DOS .ini files. This mode is automatically selected for files whose
names end with `.ini', `.kdelnk', `.props', `.properties', and for files named
`properties', `config.sys' or `.jedit-props'.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Shell Script</td> <td>sh</td> <td>For editing UNIX shell scripts. This
mode is automatically selected for files whose first line is `#!' followed
by various shell paths.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>TeX</td> <td>tex</td> <td>For editing plain TeX files. This
mode is automatically selected for files whose names end with `.tex' but
which do not contain either `\begin' or `\documentstyle' in the first 100
lines. Default compiler is `tex'.
</td>
</tr>

<a name=markers>
<h1>Markers and the Anchor</h1>
</a>

jEdit has two features which make it easier to browse around long files.<p>

The anchor is a floating location (floating meaning that if text
before it is changed, the anchor will move) that can be used to save a position
and go back later, to select large blocks of text, and to `flip' between two
positions in the document. Unlike markers, the anchor position is not saved
to disk when the file is saved.<p>

The following commands manipulate the anchor:

<ul>
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Anchor Operations-&gt;Set Anchor</b> - moves the anchor
to the current caret position.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Anchor Operations-&gt;Go to Anchor</b> - moves the caret
position to where the anchor is.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Anchor Operations-&gt;Select to Anchor</b> - selects text
from the anchor position to the caret.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Anchor Operations-&gt;Exchange Anchor and Caret</b> - moves
the caret to the anchor position, and moves the anchor to where the caret
used to be.
</ul>

Markers are more general purpose than the anchor, but they are slightly more
inconvenient to use. There can be any number of markers defined in the
file, and they are saved to disk when the file is saved. (Markers
are saved to .filename.marks where <i>filename</i> is the file)<p>

The following commands manipulate markers:

<ul>
<li><b>Search-&gt;Set Marker</b> - displays a text entry dialog where a marker
name can be entered. The default name is the current selection.
<li><b>Search-&gt;Clear Marker</b> - a menu of markers, selecting one will
clear it.
<li><b>Search-&gt;Go to Marker</b> - a menu of markers, selecting one will
move the caret position to it.
</ul>

<a name=search>
<h1>Search &amp; Replace</h1>
</a>

jEdit's Search &amp; Replace is based on regular expressions -
see <a href=regexp.html>Regular Expressions</a> if you are not familiar
with them.<p>

The actual searching and replacement commands are:

<ul>
<li><b>Search-&gt;Find</b> - displays the search &amp; replace dialog.
<li><b>Search-&gt;Find Next</b> - locates the next occurance of the search
string.
<li><b>Search-&gt;Find Selection</b> - locates the next occurance of the
selected text. Subsequent `Find Next' commands will also use the selection
as the search string.
<li><b>Search-&gt;Replace</b> - replaces the selection with the replacement
string.
<li><b>Search-&gt;Replace &amp; Find Next</b> - replaces the selection with
the replacement string and locates the next occurance of the search string.
<li><b>Search-&gt;Replace in Selection</b> - replaces all occurances of the
search string with the replacement string, in the current selection only.
<li><b>Search-&gt;Replace All</b> - replaces all occurances of the search
string with the replacement string.
<li><b>Search-&gt;HyperSearch</b> - displays the HyperSearch dialog. The
HyperSearch feature lists all lines that contain the search string. Clicking
on a line in the list will select it in the editor.
</ul>

<a name=misc>
<h1>Miscallaneous Commands</h1>
</a>

Most commands in jEdit are self-explanatory. However, there are some
exceptions - they are listed here.

<ul>
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Paste Previous</b> - displays a list of previously
copied and pasted strings available for insertion. By default, the last
100 clippings are remembered - this can be changed in
`Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General'.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Paste Predefined</b> - displays a list of frequently used
strings. Strings can be added and removed with the buttons in the dialog.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Line Operations-&gt;Go to End Indent</b> - moves the caret to
the first non-whitespace character of the current line.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Line Operations-&gt;Delete No Indent</b> - deletes the current
line except for any indent at the start.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Line Operations-&gt;Select No Indent</b> - selects the current
line except for any indent at the start.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Line Operations-&gt;Join Lines</b> - appends the next line
without any leading indent to the end of the current line.
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Expand Abbreviation</b> - attempts to complete the current
word by scanning backwards in the document looking for strings that start with
the current word. The word separator characters are defined as all
non-alphanumeric characters except for those listed in the `noWordSep'
buffer-local property. For example, if you to complete words containing `-',
place the following in the first 10 lines of the file:
<blockquote><code>(:noWordSep=-:)</code></blockquote>
<li><b>Tools-&gt;Filter Selecton</b> - filters the selection through an
external command, specified in a text entry dialog.
<li><b>Search-&gt;Select Line Range</b> - line Goto Line, but selects a
range of lines instead of moving the caret.
</ul>
