<h1>JDK 1.2 Support</h1>
</a>

jEdit now requires JDK 1.1 with Swing 1.1beta3 or JDK 1.2 to run. Swing 
1.1 is faster than Swing 1.0.x when editing text files because it uses 
an Emacs-style `gap' buffer to store the text.

<a name=syntax>
<h1>Syntax Colorizing</h1>
</a>

jEdit now does `syntax colorizing'. Syntax colorizing is the ability to 
show specific parts of text in a different color. This makes complex 
source files easier to read. jEdit colorizes the following file types:
<ul>
<li>MS-DOS Batch files
<li>C/C++ source
<li>HTML source
<li>Java source
<li>Makefiles
<li>Shell scripts
<li>TeX files
</ul>
<b>[jEdit 1.4 adds several more to this list]</b>

<a name=newCommands>
<h1>New Text Editing Commands</h1>
</a>

Several commands have been added to the `Edit' menu. They are:
<ul>
<li>`Edit->Format': formats selected text or whole buffer by wrapping long 
lines and removing duplicate spaces.
<li>`Edit->Expand Abbreviation': scans backwards for possible completions 
of current word
<li>`Edit->Locate Bracket': finds bracket that matches the one after the 
caret
<li>`Edit->Locate Block': selects the current code block, enclosed in 
brackets <b>[As of jEdit 1.3, this is Edit->Code Block Operations->Select
Code Block]</b>
<li>`Edit->Locate Paragraph': selects the current paragraph
<b>[As of jEdit 1.3, this has been replaced with several commands in the
Edit->Paragraph Operations submenu]</b>
</ul>

<a name=bufferProps>
<h1>Buffer Local Properties</h1>
</a>

Some properties such as tab size, edit mode and various mode-specific 
values can now be set on a per-file basis.

<a name=other>
<h1>Other Improvements</h1>
</a>

There are many smaller improvements in jEdit 1.2. Some of them are 
listed below.

<ul>
<li>The functionality of jOpen has been integrated into the main jEdit
program. jEdit automatically connects to the server if it is running.
This can be turned off with the `-noserver' switch.
<li>The `Mode' menu has been moved into the main menubar and out of the
`Edit' menu, and the `Go To Line', `Set Marker', `Clear Marker' and
`Go To Marker' commands have been moved from the `Edit' menu to the
`Search' menu. <b>[jEdit 1.4 rearranges the menu bar once again]</b>
<li>Views now switch to the previous, rather than the first buffer when
the current buffer is closed.
<li>jEdit should start up faster when lots of files have been specified on
the command line.
<li>The `Open in Netscape' command now prompts if the file should be saved 
first if there are unsaved changes. <b>[In jEdit 1.3 the Open in Netscape
command has been replaced by a more generic Open in WWW Browser]</b>
<li>Several minor bugs in the JAR loader were fixed.
<li>Several commands that were distributed as plugins have been moved into 
the main program.
<li>The `jedit.props' file is now stored in the jedit.jar JAR file.
<li>The documentation in jEdit 1.2 has improved quite a bit since 1.1.
</ul>
