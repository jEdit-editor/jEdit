<a name=bracketHilite>
<h1>Bracket Highlighting</h1>
</a>

If the character before the caret is a bracket, the matching bracket is
now displayed in a different color.

<a name=lineHilite>
<h1>Current Line Highlighting</h1>
</a>

The line the caret is on now has a different background color.

<a name=syntax>
<h1>Syntax Colorizing Improvements</h1>
</a>

The syntax colorizing subsystem is a lot smoother in jEdit 1.3. Major
changes from 1.2 are:

<ul>
<li>JavaScript mode added, for editing JavaScript scripts. The HTML mode
also colorizes JavaScript inside &lt;script&gt; tags.
<li>C, C++ and Java colorizing is a little bit faster because of several
optimizations.
</ul>

<a name=options>
<h1>Options Dialog Box Updates</h1>
</a>

The `Options' dialog box has been completely overhauled. It can now
change many more settings, including colors.

<a name=desktop>
<h1>Desktop Saving</h1>
</a>

When jEdit exits, a list of open files and caret positions is saved to a
`desktop' file. When jEdit is started with no command line arguments, it
reads this `desktop' file and opens the file(s).

<a name=newCommands>
<h1>New Text Editing Commands</h1>
</a>

Various new commands were added for manipulating lines, paragraphs and
the anchor, a floating marker that is useful for several purposes.

<a name=newKeys>
<h1>New Key Bindings</h1>
</a>

The key bindings for a lot of commands have changed. jEdit now supports
multiple keystroke key bindings.

<a name=pastePrev>
<h1>Paste Previous Command</h1>
</a>

The new `Paste Previous' command displays a list of previous copied and
pasted strings. Selecting one will insert it into the document.

<a name=osCmd>
<h1>External Command Support Improvements</h1>
</a>

jEdit 1.3 has several new commands for interfacing with native programs:

<ul>
<li>`Filter Selection' - writes the selected text to the
command's standard input, replacing the selection with the output.
<li>`Make' - invokes the `make' tool, usually `make' on Unix and `nmake'
on Windows.
<li>`Compile' - invokes a mode-specific compiler. For example, in Java
mode this is `javac', in C mode it's `cc', and so on. With TeX files, the
first 100 lines are checked to determine if it's a LaTeX, AMSTeX or plain
TeX file, and the appropriate variant of TeX will be invoked.
</ul>

<a name=bugFixes>
<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>
</a>

jEdit 1.3 fixes the following bugs present in 1.2:

<ul>
<li>Several Java and C keywords were missing
<li>jEdit.regionMatches() had a bug, among other things this caused
problems in HTML mode
<li>Makefile mode didn't colorize short variables properly
<li>A \$ inside a $...$ construct wasn't colorized correctly in TeX mode
<li>Path names like ../../file could cause problems
<li>More than one copy of a URL could be open at once
<li>A failed `Save As' could cause weird problems
<li>Search and replace didn't support ^ and $
<li>`Replace All' command didn't work sometimes
<li>Various Format command bugs
<li>Various Expand Abbreviation command bugs
<li>Send command didn't set the subject line properly
<li>print.java didn't compile with Sun's javac
<li>Auto indent didn't work properly with tab sizes other than 8
<li>Removed debug message from `Spaces to Tabs' command
</ul>
