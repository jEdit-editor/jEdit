<h1>Bracket Highlighting</h1>
</a>

If the character before the caret is a bracket, the matching bracket is
now highlighted.

<a name=lineHilite>
<h1>Current Line Highlighting</h1>
</a>

The line the caret is on now has a different background color.

<a name=syntax>
<h1>Syntax Colorizing Updates</h1>
</a>

The syntax colorizing subsystem is a lot smoother in jEdit 1.3. Major
changes from 1.2 are:

<ul>
<li>JavaScript mode added, for editing JavaScript scripts
<li>The HTML mode now colorizes JavaScript inside &lt;script&gt; tags
<li>C, C++ and Java colorizing is a little bit faster because of several
optimizations
</ul>

Many syntax colorizing related bugs were also fixed; see
<a href=#bugFixes>Bug Fixes</a> for details.

<a name=options>
<h1>Options Dialog Box Updates</h1>
</a>

The `Options' dialog box has been completely overhauled. It can now
change many more settings, including colors.

<a name=desktop>
<h1>Desktop Saving</h1>
</a>

When jEdit exits, a list of open files and caret positions is saved to a
`desktop' file. When jEdit is started with no command line arguments, it
reads this `desktop' file and opens the file(s).

<a name=newCommands>
<h1>New Commands</h1>
</a>

The following text editing commands are new in jEdit 1.3:

<ul>
<li>Commands for manipulating lines
<li>Commands for manipulating paragraphs
<li>Commands for shifting the indent
<li>Commands for manipulating the anchor, a floating marker that is useful
in many situations
<li>Commands for converting tabs to spaces and vice versa
<li>`Paste Previous' command for pasting previously copied strings - by default,
the last 100 strings are remebered
<li>`Filter Selection' command that writes the selected text to the
command's standard input, replacing the selection with the output
<li>`Make' command that invokes the `make' tool, usually `make' on Unix and
`nmake' on Windows
<li>`Compile' command that invokes a mode-specific compiler
</ul>

<a name=newKeys>
<h1>New Key Bindings</h1>
</a>

The key bindings for a lot of commands have changed. jEdit now supports
multiple keystroke key bindings.

<a name=bugFixes>
<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>

jEdit 1.3 fixes the following bugs present in 1.2:

problems in HTML mode
<li>Makefile mode didn't colorize short variables properly
<li>A \$ inside a $...$ construct wasn't colorized correctly in TeX mode
<li>Path names like ../../file could cause problems
<li>More than one copy of a URL could be open at once
<li>A failed `Save As' could cause weird problems
