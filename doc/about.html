<h1>About jEdit</h1>

jEdit is a text editor written in 100% Pure Java. It is NOT a word
processor - it doesn't support styled text. Instead, it can be used for
editing plain text files, such as HTML, Java source, Perl scripts, LaTeX
documents, and so on. It has many commands useful for the editing of
such files.<p>

jEdit is released under the <a href=copying.html>GNU General Public
License</a>. Basically, you can share jEdit and modify it all you want,
but you must give away your modifications under the same terms.<p>

jEdit uses gnu.regexp by the Free Software Foundation. Only the parts of
gnu.regexp used by jEdit are included - the complete package can be
found at &lt;http://www.cacas.org/java/gnu/regexp/&gt;.
