1. Starting jEdit
-----------------
Usually, jEdit is started to edit one or more files with this command:

	jedit <filename 1> <filename 2>...

Or if another instance of jEdit is already running, jOpen can be used to open
files in it:

	jopen <filename 1> <filename 2>...

jEdit can also be started with no arguments:

	jedit

In that case, it will open a new `Untitled' file. If jOpen is started with no
arguments, it opens a new view of the first buffer.

A number of options can also be given to jEdit:

	-version: Print jEdit version and exit
	-usage: Print a command line usage
	-nousrprops: Don't load user properties
	-helpdir=<dir>: Documentation directory
	-plugindir=<dir>: Plugin directory
	-server=<file>: Write server port to <file>

If jEdit is started with the jedit shell script or the jedit.bat batch file,
-helpdir, -plugindir and -server are set automatically.

jOpen also accepts certain options:

	-version: Print jOpen version and exit
	-usage: Print command line usage
	-server=<hostname>: jEdit server to connect to
	-portfile=<file>: File with server port

If jOpen is started with the jopen shell script or the jopen.bat batch file,
-portfile is set automatically.

If you want to open a file whose name starts with a dash (-), you must place
the -- argument before it in the command line to stop it from being interpreted
as an option:

	jedit -- -file-who's-name-starts-with-dash

The -- indicates the end of options. No more options after it are interpreted.

CAVEAT: If you give jOpen a relative pathname, it will be resolved relative to
jEdit's working directory, not jOpen's. For example, if jEdit was started from
/home/bob/Work, and jOpen is invoked with argument `filename' from the directory
/home/bob/Play, jEdit will try to open /home/bob/Work/filename, not
/home/bob/Play/filename as expected.

2. Platform Specific Notes
--------------------------
Unix and clones:

You need to set the PATH variable to point to the directory with the jedit and
jedit shell scripts so that the shell can locate them. The default location is
/opt/slava/bin. If you're using a Bourne shell (sh, ash, jsh, bash, zsh) The
command to add /opt/slava/bin to the PATH is:

	set PATH=$PATH:/opt/slava/bin; export PATH

If you're using a C shell (csh, tcsh) the equivalent is:

	setenv PATH $PATH:/opt/slava/bin

It is advisable to place these commands in the .profile script (Bourne shell)
or the .csh.login script (C shell) so that the PATH will be set every time you
log in.

Windows 95 and 98:

If you want to use jEdit from the command line, you must add it's directory to
the PATH. By default, jEdit is installed in C:\Program Files\jEdit. The command
to add that directory to the PATH is:

	set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\jEdit

It is advisable to place this command in your C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT so that it's
executed every time the computer starts up.

Windows NT:

The PATH is set in the System control panel in Windows NT. The default
installation directory is the same as that in Windows 95/98.

Other Platforms:

On systems without a DOS or Unix style shell such as the Mac, jEdit will have
to be started manually with the following options:

	-plugindir=<dir>: One of these for each directory with plugins
	-helpdir=<dir>: The doc directory in the jEdit distribution
	-server=<file>: Some file, in a temporary directory perhaps

jOpen will have to be started with these options:

	-portfile=<file>: The same filename specified in the -server option to
	jEdit
