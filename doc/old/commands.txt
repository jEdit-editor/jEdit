JEDIT COMMANDS

1. Command Invocation
---------------------
Commands are invoked with the jEdit.commands.execCommand(String cmd) method.
The command has the following form:
	<command name>@<argument>
Commands are defined in classes with the comamnd's name prefixed with Cmd_.

2. Command Interface
--------------------
public interface Command
{
	public static final String ARG = "arg";
	public static final String VIEW = "view";
	public abstract void init(Hashtable args);
	public abstract void exec(Hashtable args);
}

init() is called when the command is first loaded. For built in commands, this
is when it is first invoked. For plugins, it is at startup time. exec() is
called everytime the comamnd is invoked. Both take a hashtable as an argument.
The hashtable has the following keys:
- ARG - The string argument passed to the command. This isn't defined for
  the init() method.
- VIEW - The view that the command was invoked from. This isn't defined for the
  init() method if the command is a plugin.
