<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

While jEdit is primarily a programmer's text editor, it also has many
features useful for editing plain text documents and HTML and TeX files,
including several paragraph manipulation commands, a command for formatting
text, a word count feature, and several commands useful when editing HTML.
The commands described in this file are also sometimes useful when
editing program source, especially comments and such.

<a name=paragraph>
<h1>Paragraph-Based Commands</h1>
</a>

Most plain text is separated into paragraphs. jEdit defines paragraphs as
blocks of text separated by double newlines. jEdit does NOT explicitly
look for HTML &lt;p&gt; tags, nor does it support paragraphs separated
by single newlines that start with several spaces of indentation.<p>

The following commands deal with paragraphs:

<ul>
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Paragraph Operations-&gt;Go to Next Paragraph</b> - moves the caret
to the start of the next paragraph
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Paragraph Operations-&gt;Go to Previous Paragraph</b> - moves the
caret to the start ofthe previous paragraph
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Paragraph Operations-&gt;Select Next Paragraph</b> - extends the
selection to the start of the next paragraph
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Paragraph Operations-&gt;Select Previous Paragraph</b> - extends
the selection to the start of the previous paragraph
<li><b>Edit-&gt;Paragraph Operations-&gt;Delete Paragraph</b> - deletes
the paragraph containing the caret
</ul>

<b>Hint:</b> If you separate your program source into clear, logical sections
using double newlines, the paragraph commands will  be useful then, too.

<a name=format>
<h1>Formatting Text</h1>
</a>

The `Edit-&gt;Format' command reflows the selected text to the current
line width, by breaking lines at word boundaries if they are too long and
rejoining lines if there is room available. The Format command can be invoked
on several paragraphs, in which case it will format each one independently.<p>

The `maxLineLen' buffer-local property controls the maximum line length
before word wrap is done; default is 72, which makes for comfortable reading
in Windows' Notepad default window size and standard 80 column terminals.
The change it to a different value, set the buffer-local property by placing
the following in one of the first 10 lines of the file:
<pre>
	(:maxLineLen=78:)
</pre>
Of course replacing 78 with the desired line length.

<a name=wordcount>
<h1>Counting Lines, Words and Characters</h1>
</a>

The `Tools-&gt;Word Count' command counts the number of lines, words and
characters in the selection (or the entire document if
nothing is selected).

<a name=www>
<h1>Commands for Editing HTML Files</h1>
</a>

The following commands are useful when editing HTML files:

<ul>
<li><b>Tools-&gt;Open Selection in WWW Browser</b> - similar to the
above, but opens in the WWW browser that can be specified in
`Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General'.
<li><b>Tools-&gt;Open in WWW Browser</b> - opens the current file in the
WWW browser.
</ul>

<a name=tex>
<h1>Commands for Editing TeX Files</h1>
</a>

To have jEdit automatically invoke AMS-TeX, LaTeX or plain TeX, and parse
the error list, use the `Tools-&gt;Compile' command - see the
<a href=program_edit.html#compile >Compiling and Fixing Errors</a> help
topic for details.
