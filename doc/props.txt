1. Introduction
---------------
jEdit's settings, strings and menus are stored in property files. This makes
them easier to modify. For more information about menus, see menus.txt.

2. Startup
----------
jEdit loads the following property files on startup:
- The default property file. It is located in the jEdit JAR. If it could not
  be found or if there is an error loading it, jEdit will exit.
- The user's property file, unless the -nousrprops switch is specified on the
  command line. By default, this is $HOME/.jedit-props on Unix,
  %JAVAHOME%\.jedit-props on Windows 95 and 98, and %HOME%\.jedit-props on
  Windows NT. 
- Any *.props files in the plugin JARs.

3. Format
---------
Property files are in the standard Java property format. Generally, they look
like this:

opt1=value
opt2=value2
module.opt1=some value
module.opt2=some other value

4. Changing Properties
----------------------
The easiest way to change a property is to add it to your user property file.
But finding the name of the property might be tricky. If you have the full JDK
installed, you can use the jar program to extract the default properties and
copy the appropriate values to your user properties file. Use this command to
do this:

	jar xf <path to jedit.jar>/jedit.jar properties

Then you can copy the properties that you want to change to your user
properties file.
