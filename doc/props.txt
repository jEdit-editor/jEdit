1. Introduction
---------------
jEdit's settings, strings and menus are stored in property files. This makes
them easier to modify. For more information about menus, see menus.txt.

2. Startup
----------
jEdit loads the following property files on startup:
- The default property file. It is located in the jEdit JAR. If it could not
  be found or if there is an error loading it, jEdit will exit.
- The user's property file, unless the -nousrprops switch is specified on the
  command line. By default, this is ~/.jedit-props on Unix, and some
  JVM-dependent directory on Windows 95/NT.
- Any *.props files in the plugin JARs.

CAVEAT: Because the properties from the plugins are loaded after the other
property files, you can't just put some properties into your user props file to
override them. You must create your own plugin and ensure that it loads after
the plugin whose properties you want to override.

3. Format
---------
Property files are in the standard Java property format. Generally, they look
like this:

opt1=value
opt2=value2
module.opt1=some value
module.opt2=some other value

When creating your own property files, you should group related items under a
single module name.

4. Changing Properties
----------------------
The easiest way to change a property is to add it to your user property file.
But finding the name of the property might be tricky. If you have the full JDK
installed, you can use the jar program to extract the default properties and
copy the appropriate values to your user properties file. Use this command to
do this:

	jar xf <path to jedit.jar>/jedit.jar properties

Then you can copy the properties that you want to change to your user properties
file.
