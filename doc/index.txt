HELP INDEX (index.txt, last modified 18 Nov 1998)

This is the online documentation for jEdit 1.1. It is far from being complete.
If you would like to contribute, e-mail me at <slava_pestov@geocities.com>.

Some notes:
1. These files look best with a monospaced font.
2. In jEdit, files can be opened by double clicking on their name in the text
   and pressing CS-o - that is, Control-Shift-o.
3. In jEdit, you can use the `Edit->Go To Marker' menu to browse around help
   files.
