HELP INDEX (index.txt, last modified 9 Dec 1998)

This is the online documentation for jEdit 1.2. It is far from 
complete. If you would like to contribute, e-mail me at <sp@gjt.org>.

Some notes:
1. These files look best with a monospaced font.
2. In jEdit, files can be opened by double clicking on their name in the 
   text and pressing CS-o - that is, Control-Shift-o.
3. In jEdit, you can use the `Search->Go To Marker' menu to browse around 
   help files.
