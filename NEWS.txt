MAJOR CHANGES IN JEDIT 2.0 SINCE 1.6

This file outlines the major changes in jEdit 2.0 since 1.6. A complete
list can be found in the file named CHANGES.txt.

- Rewritten text component. It is faster than the old Swing-based one,
  it can properly edit files longer than 2000 lines, and has more
  functionality
- Perl syntax highlighting
- Text styles (bold, italic), in addition to colors, are used to
  highlight syntax tokens
- Literal search option
- Multifile search and replace option
- RMI interface, allowing other applications to remotely control jEdit
- The syntax package is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
  License
- A plugin is included that periodically checks if a later release of
  jEdit is available
- Console and WWW browser commands have been unbundled into plugins
  (available from <http://www.icg-online.de/jedit>)
- Busy/wait cursor is displayed while performing lengthy operations
- Configuration files are now stored in a .jedit subdirectory of the
  home directory. To retain your previous settings, move the following
  files as follows:
-- $HOME/.jedit-props to $HOME/.jedit/properties
-- $HOME/.jedit-history to $HOME/.jedit/history
-- $HOME/.jedit-jars to $HOME/.jedit/jars
-- (other files such as .jedit-desktop and .jedit-server-* can be
   deleted because they are only used by older versions of jEdit)
- The documentation has been rewritten in SGML-DocBook. It is much more
  detailed and is available in HTML and PostScript format.

There are many less important changes, and of course, lots of new bugs :)
